1.3  Using this DCP 

  Structure of this DCP 

The DCP is structured in six sections containing objectives and controls which apply to all development in the 

Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington) to which this DCP applies. Table 1-1 provides 

a summary of the content of each of the sections and the appendices. 

Table 1-1: Structure of the DCP 

Part 

Summary 

1 – Introduction  

Sets out the aims and objectives of the DCP, identifies the land to which the DCP applies, 
explains the structure of the document, the relationship of the DCP to other planning documents, 
and explains procedures for exempt and complying development and submitting a development 
application. 

2 – Precinct Planning 
Outcomes 

Sets out the general structural elements of the Indicative Layout Plan which development should 
comply with. Also establishes matters to be addressed when carrying out a site analysis to inform 
the design of subdivisions and other developments.  This part of the DCP provides the rationale 
for the more detailed and specific planning controls in the parts that follow. 

3 – Neighbourhood 
and subdivision 
design  

Provides objectives and controls related to residential subdivision design including the residential 
density and character, neighbourhood design, movement network, street and laneway design, the 
subdivision approval process and construction environmental management. 

Establishes the objectives and controls that guide residential development, including dwelling 
houses, semi-detached, attached and abutting dwellings, multi unit housing, secondary and 
studio dwellings, dual occupancies, manor homes, residential flat buildings and shop top 
housing. Also covers residential amenity controls such as streetscape, safety, privacy, 
sustainable building design and fencing. 
This section also contains controls applying to non-residential development in residential zones, 
such as child care centres, neighbourhood shops, schools and community uses. 

Provides objectives, controls and design principles for the town centres and neighbourhood 
centres, including the core retail and commercial area and the mixed use fringe areas. 

Provides controls to guide the development of industrial areas and business parks. 

A schedule for each Precinct that provides additional objectives and controls which are precinct 
specific, as well as precinct specific maps which are referred to throughout the main body of this 
DCP. 
Note that a separate schedule (Schedule 2) contains controls for the Leppington Major Centre. 
This is because it is the only major centre in the SWGC and requires specific controls.

specific, as well as precinct specific maps which are referred to throughout the main body of this 
DCP. 

Note that a separate schedule (Schedule 2) contains controls for the Leppington Major Centre. 
This is because it is the only major centre in the SWGC and requires specific controls. 

Provides details of the management of the riparian zones along the main creek lines in the 
Precinct. 

Provides details to guide subdivision and building development applications and works, to 
minimise the risk of developments increasing the risk of, and impacts from, soil and groundwater 
salinity. 

Identifies trees that are subject to the tree preservation provisions of the Precinct Plans, and 
provides a list of plant species that are preferred for use in landscaping within the Precinct.

1.4  Relationship to other planning documents 

  The Act and the Growth Centres SEPP 

This  DCP  has  been  prepared  under  the  Environmental  Planning  and  Assessment  Act,  1979.    It  has  been 

prepared  to  provide  additional  objectives,  controls  and  guidance  to  applicants  proposing  to  undertake 

development in the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington), and for Council reference 

in  the  assessment  of  development  applications.    It  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Growth  Centres 

SEPP, in particular the specific Precinct Plans which are included as Appendices of the SEPP.  The Growth 

Centres SEPP and the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington) provide the statutory 

planning controls for development in the Precinct. This DCP is consistent with and supports those controls by 

providing more detail in relation to how development is to occur in the Precinct. 

  Campbelltown Council planning documents 

The following Campbelltown Council planning documents do not apply to land that a Precinct Plan applies to: 

  Campbelltown (Urban Area) Local Environmental Plan 2002; 

  Campbelltown Local Environmental Plan No 209 - Exempt Development; 

  Campbelltown Local Environmental Plan - District 8 (Central Hills Lands); and 

  Campbelltown (Sustainable City) Development Control Plan. 

except if specifically referred to in the Growth Centres SEPP and this DCP. Some other design standards and 

guidelines of Council do continue to apply, such as the Council’s Engineering Design Guide for Development.  

Where  existing  policies,  procedures  and  guidelines  continue  to  apply  to  the  Precinct,  these  are  specifically 

referred to in the relevant sections of this DCP.  

  Growth Centres Biodiversity Certification 

The  Threatened  Species  Conservation  Act  1995  (the  TSC  Act)  provides  for  the  protection  of  threatened 

species, populations, endangered ecological communities, and critical habitat in NSW.  Typically, threatened 

species  issues  are  addressed  during  both  the  rezoning  of  land  and  when  development  applications  are 

submitted  and  assessed  by  Council.    However,  the  TSC  Act  also  provides  for  planning  instruments  to  be 

“Certified”, meaning that the assessment of threatened species is done at the rezoning stage and does not 

need to be further considered at the development application stage.  This approach provides for more strategic 

assessment  and  management  of  threatened  species  issues,  and  streamlines  the  development  application 

process. 

Biodiversity Certification was conferred upon the Growth Centres SEPP on 14 December 2007 via the gazettal 

of a Biodiversity Certification Order signed by the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment.  The Order 

requires  2,000  ha  of  “existing  native  vegetation”  (ENV)  to  be  retained  across  the  Growth  Centres.  Any 

clearance of ENV within Non-Certified Areas will be required to undertake a TSC assessment and vegetation 

removal may need to be offset in accordance with the Biodiversity Certification Ministerial Order. 

########Page6 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
The East Leppington Indicative Layout Plan, Precinct Plan and this DCP have been prepared in accordance 

with  the  Biodiversity  Certification  Order.  The  majority  of  land  within  the  Growth  Centre  Precinct  is  certified, 

meaning  that  development  can  occur  without  the  need  for  further  assessment  under  the  TSC  Act.    The 

Campbelltown  Growth  Centres  Precinct  Plan  (East  Leppington)  contains  controls  to  restrict  the  clearing  of 

“Existing Native Vegetation” and this is the principle mechanism for ensuring consistency with the Biodiversity 

Certification  Order.    This  DCP  contains  other  objectives  and  controls  in  relation  to  the  protection  and 

enhancement of native vegetation, consistent with the Biodiversity Certification Order.  

  Summary of applicable planning documents 

Applicants  proposing  to  undertake  development  in  the  Precinct,  and  Council  when  assessing  development 

applications, should refer to: 

 

 

 

 

the Growth Centres SEPP, as amended, including the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East 

Leppington); 

this DCP;  

a relevant Section 94 Contributions Plan and/or Voluntary Planning Agreement; and 

the  Growth  Centres  Biodiversity  Certification  Order,  December  2007  and  related  amendments  to  the 

Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. 

1.5  Consent authority 

Unless otherwise authorised by the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 Campbelltown Council 

is the consent authority for all development in the Precinct to  which this DCP applies on  land that is  within 

Campbelltown Local Government Area.  

Council will use this DCP in its assessment of development applications.   

1.6  Exempt and Complying Development 

The Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 enables certain forms of development to be classified 

as either exempt development or complying development through Environmental Planning Instruments.   

Exempt  development  is  development  of  a  minor  nature  that  can  be  undertaken  without  the  need  for 

development consent.   

Complying development is development that, providing it meets pre-determined development standards, can 

be assessed through the issuance of a complying development certificate. 

The  State  Environmental  Planning  Policy  (Exempt  and  Complying  Development  Codes)  2008,  and  the 

associated Housing Code provides controls for the siting and design of detached housing on lots 200m² and 

larger as well as alterations and additions to existing residential dwellings up to two storeys. Basements and 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page7 

 
ancillary development are included as permitted forms of development. Development that meets the criteria in 

the Housing Code is complying development and this DCP does not apply. Where a development does not 

meet the requirements of the Housing Code, consent is required and this DCP applies.  

The NSW Commercial and Industrial Code outlines how internal modifications to commercial and industrial 

premises in certain zones can meet the complying development criteria. Where a development does not meet 

the requirements of these Codes, consent is required and this DCP applies.

Notes: 

Notification  is  where  Council  writes  to  those  people  identified  as  requiring  notification,  advising  of  the 
submission of a development application. Notification is for a minimum period of 14 days.  

Advertising  is  where  Council,  in  addition  to  writing  to  those  people  required  to  be  notified,  places  an 
advertisement in a local newspaper advising of the submission of a development application. Advertising is for 
a minimum period of 14 days unless otherwise specified by legislation or Environmental Planning Instruments 
in the case of Integrated, Designated and Advertised Development. 

Each  Council  has  a  Policy  which  establishes  the  types  of  development  applications  that  will  be  notified  or 
advertised. 

  Information to be submitted with Development Applications 

Applicants  are  required  to  submit  information  with  all  development  applications  that  clearly  illustrates  and 

describes  the  development  proposal,  and  demonstrates  consistency  with  the  relevant  planning  controls 

particularly the  Campbelltown Growth Centres  Precinct Plan (East  Leppington)  and this DCP.  The level of 

detail  and  the  range  of  issues  to  be  addressed  by  applicants  vary  depending  on  the  type  and  scale  of 

development  that  is  proposed.  Some  information  is  required  for  all  development  applications,  while  more 

detailed or specific information is required only for some types of development.  

Council’s  checklist  for  information  required  to  be  referred  to  prior  to  preparation  of  any  application  and  is 

available at www.campbelltown.nsw.gov.au. 

Considerable background work has been undertaken to inform the preparation of the ILP and planning controls 

for the Precinct. This information is available either by contacting Council or the Department of Planning and 

Infrastructure.  

In  some  cases,  Precinct  Planning  studies  and  reports  may  be  sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  lodging  a 

Application, while for some properties or some development types, more detailed information may need to be 

prepared.  Applicants should discuss the suitability of studies prepared as part of Precinct Planning with Council 

prior to preparing development application documentation, to determine if additional studies or documentation 

will be required.   

The  ILP  and  Planning  Controls  have  been  prepared  based  on  the  Precinct  Planning  studies.    Where 

applications propose a development type or design that differs from the ILP or doesn’t comply with the planning 

controls  (refer  to  Section  1.7.3),  additional  technical  studies  are  likely  to  be  required  to  justify  the  non-

compliance.  

########Page10 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
  Variations to Development Controls and DCP Amendments 

Compliance with the Indicative Layout Plan 

The Precinct Indicative Layout Plan in Figure 2-1 is intended to show how the overall Precinct will develop 

over time.  It shows how the numerous developments, undertaken over numerous years, will come together to 

ensure  the  overall  development  of  the  Precinct  is  integrated,  sustainable  and  attractive.    However,  it  is 

recognised that some variation to the layout shown on the ILP may be reasonable to address new or more 

detailed information about the site, or other factors that might influence individual developments.  

Council may grant consent to a proposal that differs from the Indicative Layout Plan (ILP), where the variation 

is  considered  to  be  minor  and  the  proposal  is  demonstrated  to  be  generally  consistent  with  the  ILP. 

Development applications will be considered on their merits, and applicants are required to demonstrate that 

the proposed variation is: 

  Consistent  with  the  Campbelltown  Growth  Centres  Precinct  Plan  (East  Leppington)  under  the  Growth 

Centres SEPP; 

  Consistent with the Precinct Planning Outcomes and Precinct Vision in Part 2 of this DCP; 

  Not likely to significantly impact on the amenity, safety or environmental quality of adjoining lands, or the 

ability of adjoining development to occur generally in accordance with this DCP. 

Where a proposed variation to the DCP does not meet the above requirements, Council may either: 

 

 

 

refuse consent for the application;  

condition the development consent to ensure the above requirements are achieved subject to compliance 

with any condition Council imposes; or  

request the applicant to demonstrate that amendment of the DCP is warranted and the relevant standard 

would not be eroded to enable the development to be approved.   

Amendment of the DCP will only be considered where the amendment would not significantly alter the planning 

outcomes for the Precinct.  Typically, DCP amendments will not be undertaken to address issues that relate 

only to a single development: these issues should be dealt with by addressing the criteria for ILP variations 

above.  Amendments will usually only be considered where the change relates to an aspect of the ILP that is 

demonstrably unreasonable or unnecessary, or where amendments are appropriate to address issues that will 

affect development generally in the Precinct. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page11 

 
Compliance with Objectives and Controls in this DCP 

Each section in this DCP contains Objectives and Controls relating to various aspects of development (for 

example, building setbacks, requirements for car parking, or minimum requirements for landscaping).  

The  Objectives  enable  Council  and  Applicants  to  consider  whether  a  particular  proposal  will  achieve  the 

development outcomes established for the Precinct in the ILP. 

The Controls establish consistent standards, which if met, mean that development should be consistent with 

the Objectives.  However, in some circumstances, strict compliance with the controls may not be necessary, 

or may be difficult to achieve because of the particular characteristics of a development site.  In these situations, 

Council may grant consent  to a proposal that does not comply  with the Controls in this DCP, providing the 

intent (i.e. the Objective/s) of the Controls is achieved. Where a variation is sought it must be justified in writing 

by  indicating  how  the  development  will  meet  the  Objectives  of  the  relevant  Control  and/or  is  generally 

consistent with the ILP.

2.1 

Introduction 

This  Part  of  the  DCP  defines  Precinct  wide  planning  outcomes.  The  specific  way  the  outcomes  are  to  be 

achieved for the East Leppington Precinct is established by the Indicative Layout Plan. This part also outlines 

the matters to be considered when undertaking site analysis for subdivision planning. These controls should 

be considered during the initial stages of subdivision planning to determine the suitability and the development 

potential of land. 

2.2  The Indicative Layout Plan 

An Indicative Layout Plan (ILP) is contained in Figure 2-1 below.  The Indicative Layout Plan forms the basis 

for urban development in the Precinct by setting out:    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the road network; 

public transport routes; 

the open space and drainage networks; 

the locations of land uses including residential development, schools, community facilities, utilities, centres 

and employment lands; 

areas requiring protection because of environmental or heritage values; 

the density and types of housing that are preferred in various parts of the Precinct. 

Objectives 

a. 

To ensure that development in the Precinct occurs in a coordinated manner consistent with the East 

Leppington Indicative Layout Plan. 

Controls 

1. 

All  development  applications  are  to  be  generally  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Indicative  Layout 

Plan. 

2. 

When  assessing  development  applications,  Council  will  consider  the  extent  to  which  the  proposed 

development is consistent with the Indicative Layout Plan.   

3. 

Any  proposed  variations  to  the  general  arrangement  of  the  Indicative  Layout  Plan  must  be 

demonstrated by the applicant, to Council’s satisfaction, to be consistent with the Precinct Planning 

vision in Section 2.3 of this DCP.

2.3 

 East Leppington Precinct Vision 

The vision for the East Leppington Precinct is to develop a series of new walkable residential neighbourhoods 

supported by local retail, community and recreation facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner. 

The Precinct will provide:  

  For a range of residential densities, housing types and affordability options to meet the needs of a 

diverse and growing community.  

  Detached housing will comprise the majority of residential development, with medium density 

development located close to the local centre, along bus routes and areas of higher amenity with 

larger lots on the periphery of the Precinct. 

  A Local Centre located at the ‘gateway’ of the East Leppington Precinct.  The Local Centre will be the 

main retail centre, providing for a mix of retail, commercial and community services to cater for the 

needs of local residents. It will be highly accessible by all modes of transport, being located off 

Camden Valley Way and surrounded by medium density residential and mixed use development.  

  A public domain that will include special places focused on important landscape and cultural features 

including the Leppington House archaeological site. Passive recreation opportunities will be 

maximised along the Bonds Creek riparian corridor whilst active recreation opportunities will be 

catered through the provision of sporting fields. Where possible, remnant vegetation will be retained 

in public parks and areas containing endangered ecological communities will be conserved. The 

visual and landscape quality of the Scenic Hills will be protected. 

  For the incorporation of principles of ecological sustainability and measures to ensure that the 

important historic, environmental and visual elements of the Precinct are recognised and protected 

for future generations.  

Note: This part sets  out the precinct  planning vision for  East Leppington Precinct and  includes figures that 

support the objectives, controls and design principles for subdivision planning and design in this section of the 

DCP.

########Page17 

 
2.4  Subdivision site analysis 

The following sections contain matters to be addressed in relation to existing site characteristics, when planning 

new subdivisions. 

  Flooding  

Objectives 

a. 

To  manage  the  flow  of  stormwater  from  urban  parts  of  the  East  Leppington  Precinct  to  meet  pre-

development flows at specific locations, 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To define the flood constraints and standards applicable to development in the Precinct, 

To minimise the potential of flooding impacts on development, and 

To  incorporate  best  practice  stormwater  management  principles  and  strategies  in  development 

proposals. 

Controls  

1. 

2. 

The Council’s Engineering Design Guide for Development applies unless otherwise specified.  

The pattern of subdivision is to ensure that no new dwelling is required to be located within the post-

development 1% AEP flood extent shown on the Flood Prone Land Figure (refer to Figure 2-2). 

3. 

The 1% AEP flood extent may be varied based on more detailed flood studies that are prepared to 

the satisfaction of Council. 

4. 

Pedestrian and cycle pathways and open space may extend within the 1% AEP flood level, provided 

the safe access criteria contained in the NSW Floodplain Development Manual are met. Reference 

should also be made to Appendix B (Riparian Protection Area controls). Figure 2-2 shows the 

approximate extent of the 1% AEP flood level. 

Note: Where development is proposed within or adjacent to land that is shown in Figure 2-2, as being affected 
by the 1% AEP level, Council may require a more detailed flood study to be undertaken by the applicant to 
confirm the extent of the flood affectation on the subject land. 

5. 

6. 

Roads adjoining Bonds Creek and its tributaries are to be located above the 1% AEP level.   

Existing roads that are below the 1% AEP level may be retained or upgraded on the current vertical 

alignment, providing safe evacuation routes can be provided, where they provide access to existing 

development and where elevation of the road to achieve a higher level of flood immunity would: 

  Unreasonably restrict, or require significant modifications to access to properties; or 

  Restrict overland flow paths or the installation of stormwater pipes; or 

  Result in unacceptable flooding impacts on other properties; or 

  Upgrading  of  the  road  would  require  removal  of  Existing  Native  Vegetation  mapped  under  the 

Growth Centres SEPP. 

########Page18 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
7. 

The design of the road network is to ensure that evacuation routes from existing development and/or 

adjoining properties are maintained, or suitable alternative evacuation routes are provided, for flood 

events up to and including the PMF flood event. Evacuation routes are to be identified during early 

planning of the road network.  

8. 

In general, Council will not support development, including the filling of land, within the floodway due 

to its function as the main flow path for flood waters once the main channel has overflowed and the 

possibility of a significant threat to life and property in a major flood, unless in accordance with post-

development flood levels (subject to Control 3) 

9. 

An application lodged for development in a floodway (other than agriculture, cultivation and minor 

alterations to existing buildings) shall be accompanied by a survey plan to satisfactorily demonstrate 

that: 

  The development will not increase flood hazard or damage to other properties or adversely affect 

them  in  any  way,  by  the  provision  of  a  report  from  a  professional  civil  engineer  experienced  in 

hydraulics. 

10. 

Applications may be required to indicate that permanent fail-safe, maintenance-free measures are 

incorporated in the development to ensure the timely, orderly and safe evacuation of people from the 

area should a flood occur.  In addition, it may also be necessary to demonstrate that the 

displacement of these people during times of flood will not significantly add to the overall community 

cost and community disruption caused by the flood. 

11. 

Applications may be required to indicate proposed flood proofing of the structure to the satisfaction of 

Council.

  Water cycle management 

Objectives 

a. 

To avoid adverse impacts from stormwater runoff on other properties as a result of development in the 

catchment for all storm events up to and including a 100-year ARI event, 

b. 

c. 

To minimise potable water consumption and maximise re-use of stormwater within urban areas, and 

To maintain and enhance the quality of natural water bodies. 

Controls 

1. 

Stormwater within new subdivisions is to be managed through a gravity network of pipes and 

overland flows generally following streets where flow volumes exceed the capacity of pipes. 

All new development is to be connected, via the network described in control 1 above, to the Council’s trunk 

drainage system shown on the Key elements of the water cycle management and open space Figure (refer 

to 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page21 

 
2. 

3. 

Figure 2-3). 

The acquisition of drainage easements over downstream properties will be required where direct 

access to Council’s drainage system or discharge of stormwater to a creek via the street network is 

not possible (i.e. street kerb and gutter, piped system or open channels and watercourses).  

However, the design of subdivisions is to generally comply with controls 1 and 2 above and 

########Page22 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
management of stormwater through easements will only be permitted by Council in exceptional 

circumstances where no other practical solution is available. 

4. 

All outlet structures discharging to a creek system shall provide scour protection and energy 

dissipaters to minimise erosion of creek banks and beds. The number of outlet connections is to be 

minimised.  

Roads on primary drainage lines shown on 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page23 

 
5. 

Figure 2-3 are to be constructed generally in the locations shown, and should be designed in 

accordance with specifications of Council in relation to management of stormwater flows and quality.   

6. 

Some development areas within certain areas may not drain to the trunk stormwater system.  In 

these locations, stormwater detention is managed by offsetting flows from these areas in detention 

########Page24 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
basins located on other catchments.  Water quality treatment is still required for these areas and is to 

be managed within the street network.   

7. 

Management of ‘minor’ flows using piped systems for the minimum 20% AEP (residential land use) 

and 10% AEP (commercial land use) shall be in accordance with Council’s Guide DCP Volume 2. 

Management measures shall be designed to: 

  prevent damage by stormwater to the built and natural environment, 

 

reduce nuisance flows to a level which is acceptable to Council, 

  provide a stormwater system which can be economically maintained and which uses open space 

in a compatible manner, 

 

control flooding, 

  minimise urban water run-off pollutants to watercourses. 

8. 

Management of ‘major’ flows using dedicated overland flow paths such as open space areas, roads 

and riparian corridors for all flows in excess of the pipe drainage system capacity and above the 20% 

AEP shall be in accordance with Council’s Engineering Design Guide for Development. Management 

measures shall be designed to: 

  Ensures flows satisfy safety requirements, 

  prevent both short term and long term inundation of habitable dwellings, 

 

control flooding and enable access to lots, stabilise the land form and control erosion, 

  provide for the orderly and safe evacuation of people away from rising floodwaters. 

9. 

Where practical, development shall attenuate up to the 50% AEP peak flow for discharges into the 

local tributaries.  

10. 

The developed 1% AEP peak flow is to be maintained at pre-development flows through the 

incorporation of stormwater detention and management devices.  Where subdivision works occur 

prior to the completion of required trunk drainage works, on site facilities will need to be provided in 

order to limit drainage volume and velocity to that experienced prior to development and to address 

water quality controls. 

11. 

The trunk stormwater system is to be constructed in accordance with the Council’s Engineering 

Design Guide, and to achieve the water quality targets in Table 2-1. 

12. 

Where development is located on land that drains towards the Sydney Catchment Authority Upper 

Canal, specific water quality measures may be required to ensure that development does not 

adversely impact on the quality of water in the Upper Canal.  Specific controls are contained in this 

DCP. 

13. 

Where development on land affected by local runoff or local overland flooding – major drainage is 

proposed, it must be designed in accordance with Council’s Engineering Design Guide for 

Development.

  Salinity and soil management 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To manage and mitigate the impacts of, and on, salinity and sodicity, 

To minimise the damage caused to property and vegetation by existing saline soils, or processes that 

may create saline soils, 

To ensure development will not significantly increase the salt load in existing watercourses, and 

To prevent degradation of the existing soil and groundwater environment, and in particular, to minimise 

erosion and sediment loss and water pollution due to siltation and sedimentation. 

Controls 

1. 

Subdivision development applications, that include earthworks, on land with a moderate to high risk of 

salinity (identified in Figure 2-4), are to be accompanied by information detailing how the design and 

construction of the proposed subdivision intends to address salinity issues.  All works are to comply 

with the Western Sydney Salinity Code of Practice 2004 (WSROC) and Appendix C.  

2. 

Salinity and sodicity management related to Appendix C is to complement WSUD strategies, improving 

or at least maintaining the current condition, without detriment to the waterway environment. 

3. 

All  development  must  incorporate  soil  conservation  measures  to  minimise  soil  erosion  and  siltation 

during  construction  and  following  completion  of  development.  Soil  and  Water  Management  Plans, 

prepared  in  accordance  with  Managing  Urban  Stormwater  -  Soils  and  Construction  (Landcom  3rd 

Edition  March  2004  (‘The  Blue  Book’)  are  to  be  submitted  with  each  subdivision  development 

application. 

4. 

Salinity shall be considered during the planning, design and carrying out of earthworks, rehabilitation 

works and during the siting, design and construction of all development including infrastructure: 

  To protect development and other works from salinity damage; and   

  To minimise the potential impacts that development and other works may have on salinity.  

Note: Reference should be made to Councils Development Application checklist, refer to Section 1.7.2.

  Native vegetation and ecology 

Note: Reference should be made to the Growth Centres Biodiversity Certification under the NSW Threatened 
Species Conservation Act 1995 (TSC Act).Where land has been certified it enables development applications 
to be considered without the need for further assessment under section 5A of the Environmental Planning & 
Assessment Act 1979.  

Objectives 

a. 

To  conserve  and  rehabilitate  the  remaining  native  vegetation  and  trees  within  the  East  Leppington 

Precinct, 

b. 

To  ensure  that  native  vegetation  contributes  to  the  character  and  amenity  of  the  East  Leppington 

Precinct, and 

c. 

To conserve the ecological values of the Precinct, and ecological links to surrounding areas. 

Controls 

1. 

Native trees and other vegetation are to be retained where possible by careful planning of subdivisions 

to incorporate trees into areas such as private allotments, the public domain or within road reserves. 

2. 

When assessing an application that proposes removal of a tree or trees, consideration will be given to 

whether the tree or trees: 

  Are listed on any Council register of significant trees. 

 

Is prominent due to its height, size, position or age. 

3. 

4. 

Buildings are to be set back a minimum of 3 metres from existing trees that are to be retained. 

The design and location of access driveways should wherever possible be located to avoid or minimise 

removal of existing trees.  

5. 

Council may consider alternative street cross section designs where the typical cross section would 

result in removal of existing trees that could otherwise be retained. 

6. 

Where practical, prior to development commencing, applicants are to: 

  provide for the appropriate re-use of native plants; and 

 

relocate native animals from development sites. Applicants should refer to  OEH’s Policy on the 

Translocation of Threatened Fauna in NSW.

Figure 2-3: 

  all existing native vegetation is to be retained and rehabilitated, except where clearing is required 

for essential infrastructure such as roads, footpaths, cycleways and drainage; and 

  native vegetation is to be conserved and managed in accordance with the Guidelines for Corridors 

prepared by the NSW Office of Water. 

########Page32 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
8. 

Development on land that adjoins land zoned E2 Environmental Conservation is to ensure that there 

are no significant detrimental impacts to the native vegetation and ecological values of the E2 zoned 

land. 

Note: Refer to the Biodiversity Consistency Report 2013 for the East Leppington Precinct for  advice on the 
long term intent and appropriate management of land zoned E2 Environment Conservation. 

9. 

All subdivision design and bulk earthworks are to consider the need to minimise weed dispersion and 

to eradicate weeds on site. If Council believes that a significant weed risk exists, a Weed Eradication 

and  Management  Plan  outlining  weed  control  measures  during  and  after  construction  is  to  be 

submitted with the subdivision development application. 

10. 

A Landscape Plan is to be submitted with all subdivision development applications that create a new 

road and/or more than 2 allotments, identifying: 

  all existing trees on the development site and those that are proposed to be removed or retained; 

 

the  proposed  means  of  protecting  trees  to  be  retained  during  both  construction  of  subdivision 

works and construction of buildings;  

  proposed landscaping including the locations and species of trees, shrubs and ground cover to be 

planted as part of subdivision works;  

 

the relationship of the proposed landscaping to native vegetation that is to be retained within public 

land, including factors such as the potential for weed or exotic species invasion and the contribution 

of the proposed landscaping to the creation of habitat values and ecological linkages throughout 

the Precinct; and 

  How bushfire risk has been managed, including requirements for Asset Protection Zones and how 

these relate to the proposed landscaping. 

11.  The selection of trees and other landscaping plants is to consider: 

  Council’s policies including Campbelltown DCP No.114 Trees, Campbelltown Tree Planting Guide 

and Native Gardening Guide for the Campbelltown Local Government Area and other applicable 

Council guidelines; 

  The use of locally indigenous species where available; 

  Bushfire risk; 

  Contribution to the management of soil salinity, groundwater levels and soil erosion; 

 

Items  of  environmental  heritage,  heritage  conservation  areas,  historic  road  alignments  and 

significant view lines. 

12. 

For the purposes of clause 5.9 of the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington), 

prescribed trees include: 

  Trees taller than the minimum height and greater than the minimum trunk diameter specified in 

Appendix D and; 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page33 

 
  Tree species listed in Appendix D. 

Figure 2-5: Example of retained significant trees in a local park 

Note:  Where  applicable,  clause  5.9  of  the  Campbelltown  Growth  Centres  Precinct  Plan  (East  Leppington) 
requires development consent or a permit to ringbark, cut down, top, lop, remove, injure or wilfully destroy any 
tree or other vegetation that is prescribed by this DCP, except where other requirements of clause 5.9 are met. 

  Bushfire hazard management 

Objectives 

a. 

To  prevent  loss  of  life  and  property  due  to  bushfires  by  providing  for  development  compatible  with 

bushfire hazard, and 

b. 

To encourage sound management of bushfire-prone areas. 

Controls 

1. 

Reference is to be made to Planning for Bushfire Protection 2006 in subdivision planning and design 

and development is to be consistent with Planning for Bushfire Protection 2006. 

2. 

Subject to detailed design at development application stage, the indicative location and widths of Asset 

Protection Zones (APZs) are to be provided generally in accordance with the Bushfire risk and Asset 

Protection  Zone  Requirements  (refer  to  Figure  2-10).  APZs  and  construction  standards  are  to  be 

accurately  mapped  and  detailed  for  each  affected  lot  on  plans  submitted  with  the  development 

application. 

3. 

APZs: 

  are to be located wholly within the Precinct; 

  may incorporate roads and flood prone land, 

########Page34 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
 
  may  be  located  within  the  vegetated  buffer  (subject  to  the  Guidelines  for  Riparian  Corridors 

prepared by the NSW Office of Water (as issued from time to time). Refer to Appendix B, 

  may be used for open space and recreation subject to appropriate fuel management, 

  are to be maintained in accordance with the guidelines in Planning for Bushfire Protection 2006, 

  may incorporate private residential land, but only within the building setback (no dwellings are to 

be located within the APZ), 

  are not to burden public land except where consistent with control 4 below, and 

  are to be generally bounded by a public road or perimeter fire trail that is linked to the public road 

system at regular intervals in accordance with Planning for Bushfire Protection 2006. 

4. 

Indicative cross-sections for perimeter roads and properties adjacent to the Precinct boundary near St 

James Road are provided in Figure 2-6 and Figure 2-7.  

5. 

Where  an  allotment  fronts  and  partially  incorporates  an  APZ  it  shall  have  an  appropriate  depth  to 

accommodate a dwelling with private open space and the minimum required APZ. The APZ will be 

identified through a Section 88B instrument. 

6. 

Temporary APZs, identified through a Section 88B instrument, will be required where development is 

proposed on allotments next to undeveloped land that presents a bushfire hazard. Once the adjacent 

stage of development is undertaken, the temporary APZ will no longer be required and shall cease. 

7. 

Reticulated  water  is  to  meet  the  standards  contained  within  Planning  for  Bushfire  Protection  2006. 

Water supply is to be via a ring main system, engineered to the requirements of Australian Standard 

2419.1-1994 Fire Hydrant Installations. 

8. 

Buildings adjacent to APZs are to be constructed in accordance with the requirements of Appendix 3

  Site contamination 

Objectives 

a. 

To  minimise  the  risks  to  human  health  and  the  environment  from  the  development  of  potentially 

contaminated land, and 

b. 

To ensure that potential site contamination issues are adequately addressed at the subdivision stages. 

Controls 

1. 

All  subdivision  development  applications  (or  for  applications  proposing  a  change  of  use  to  a  more 

sensitive land use (eg. Residential, education, public recreation facility etc), shall be accompanied by 

a  Stage  1  Preliminary  Site  Investigation  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  NSW EPA  Contaminated 

Sites  Guidelines,  State  Environmental  Planning  Policy  55  –  Remediation  of  Land  and  the 

Contaminated Land Management Act, 1995 and relevant Council Policies. 

2. 

Where the Stage 1 Investigation identifies potential or actual site contamination a Stage 2 Detailed 

Site Investigation must be prepared in accordance with the NSW EPA Contaminated Sites Guidelines, 

State  Environmental  Planning  Policy  55  –  Remediation  of  Land  and  the  Contaminated  Land 

Management  Act,  1995  and  relevant  Council  Policies.   A  Remediation  Action  Plan  (RAP)  will  be 

required for areas identified as contaminated land in the Stage 2 Site Investigation. 

3. 

Development applications for development in “high risk” areas of potential contamination Risk-ranking 

Figure in the East Leppington Preliminary Environmental Site Assessment (JBS Environmental, 2012) 

shall be accompanied by a Stage 2 Detailed Environmental Site Investigation prepared in accordance 

with  the  NSW  EPA  Contaminated  Sites  Guidelines,  State  Environmental  Planning  Policy  55  – 

Remediation  of  Land  and  the  Contaminated  Land  Management  Act,  1995  and  Council’s  Policy  – 

Management of Contaminated Lands. If remediation is required, a Remediation Action Plan (RAP) is 

to be prepared and submitted as part of the DA that seeks consent for remediation. Council may require 

a  Site  Audit  Statement  (SAS)  (issued  by  an  NSW  Accredited  Site  Auditor)  during  any  stage  of  the 

investigation or remediation process. 

4. 

All  investigation,  reporting  and  identified  remediation  works  must  be  in  accordance  with  the  NSW 

EPA’s  (now  Office  of  Environment  and  Heritage)  Guidelines  for  Consultants  Reporting  on 

Contaminated Sites and SEPP 55 – Contaminated Land and relevant Council policies.  

5. 

Prior to granting development consent, the consent authority must be satisfied that the site is suitable, 

or can be made suitable, for the proposed use. Remediation works identified in any RAP will require 

development consent prior to the works commencing. 

6. 

Council may require a Site Audit Statement (SAS) (issued by an NSW Accredited Site Auditor) to be 

provided at any stage of the contamination investigation, remediation or validation stages. 

Notes:  

########Page38 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
 
All  applicants  should  consider  and  assess  contamination  hazards  on  their  land  in  accordance  with  the 
Contaminated  Land  Management  Act,  1995  and  State  Environmental  Planning  Policy  55  –  Remediation  of 
Land, both of which override any controls in this DCP. 

A site audit may be necessary when the Council believes on reasonable grounds that the information provided 
by the proponent is incorrect or incomplete, wishes to verify that information provided by the proponent adheres 
to appropriate standards, procedures and guidelines or does not have the internal resources to conduct its own 
technical review. 

  Development on and adjacent to electricity and gas easements 

Objectives 

a. 

To ensure that development on or adjacent to land affected by major infrastructure easements does 

not impact on the continued operation of the infrastructure, 

b. 

c. 

To provide for the safety and amenity of residents living near infrastructure easements, and 

To encourage applicants to find appropriate uses for land burdened by an easement having regard to 

the particular circumstances in each case. 

Controls 

Subdivision of land that is affected by easements and land adjacent to easements, as shown in 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page39 

 
 
1.  Figure 2-9, is to be consistent with the controls in this part of the DCP. 

2.  Where development is proposed on land containing or adjacent to easements, applicants are to consult 

with  the  organisation responsible for management of the easement as part of the process of preparing 

subdivision or other development plans.  Any written requirements of the infrastructure organisation are to 

########Page40 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
be  submitted  with  the  development  application,  and  the  development  application  documentation  is  to 

demonstrate how the requirements have been addressed in the design. 

3.  Road crossings over the easement are to be minimised, to be generally in the locations shown on the East 

Leppington Precinct Indicative Layout Plan (refer to Figure 2-1), and are to be designed in accordance 

with any requirements issued by the organisation responsible for management of the infrastructure. 

4.  Earthworks  (excavation  or  filling)  and  landscaping  within  easements  are  subject  to  conditions  and 

requirements of the infrastructure organisation. 

5.  Subdivision of easements is to be minimised. 

6.  Requirements  of  the  infrastructure  organisation  in  relation  to  access  to  easements  for  inspections  and 

maintenance are to be addressed in the design of the development.  Access to the easement from public 

land (eg. roads, open space or drainage land) is preferable.

  Noise 

Objectives 

########Page42 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
a. 

To  minimise  the  impacts  of  noise  from  major  transport  infrastructure  and  employment  areas  on 

residential amenity, and 

b. 

To achieve an acceptable residential noise environment whilst maintaining well designed and attractive 

residential streetscapes. 

Controls 

1. 

Figure 2-10 provides guidance to applicants on measures to mitigate the impacts of traffic noise within 

the Precinct. 

Figure 2-10: Measures to attenuate noise 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page43 

 
 
2. 

Development will require an acoustic report where it is in a location such as: 

  adjacent to an arterial road and/or sub-arterial roads;  

  potentially impacted upon by a nearby employment area; or 

  potentially impacting upon sensitive receivers such as residences within the precinct and outside 

the precinct. 

3. 

Subdivision  design  on  land  adjacent  to  significant  noise  sources  is  to  consider  and  implement 

measures to attenuate noise within dwellings. 

4. 

Physical noise barriers (ie. Noise walls or solid fencing) are not generally supported, and measures to 

attenuate noise through subdivision layout, such as setbacks, building orientation, and building design 

and materials selection should be implemented to achieve appropriate internal noise standards. 

  Odour assessment and control 

Odour management is subject to the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. Currently the only 

methods of controlling odour impacts are applying buffers around odour generating activities and industry best 

management practices. 

Prior to the commencement of this DCP the Growth Centre precincts were mostly zoned for rural purposes. 

The  Precincts,  and  nearby  rural  areas,  contain  a  number  of  existing  rural  uses  that  have  the  potential  to 

generate odour and other associated impacts that may affect the amenity of nearby urban areas. While these 

activities may cease operation at some point in the future (such as when the land is rezoned and developed 

for urban purposes) the timing of cessation of odour generating land uses is not known nor able to be controlled 

by  Council  or  the  Department  of  Planning  &  Infrastructure.    Developers  and  buyers  of  property  within  the 

Growth Centre precincts should be aware that their property may be subject to odour impacts from these uses 

for an indeterminate period of time.  

Where land is deemed by Council to be affected by an odour source Council will consider whether the type of 

development in this area is appropriate and will also consider the need for the applicant to provide additional 

supporting information with the development application (refer to Figure 2-11). An odour assessment prepared 

by an appropriate qualified person in accordance with the EPA Draft Policy " Assessment and Management of 

Odour from Stationary Sources in NSW” and Technical Notes may be required to be submitted.

2.5  Demolition 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To minimise waste generation and disposal to landfill, 

To ensure efficient storage and collection of wastes and recyclables during demolition and construction 

stages, 

To minimise adverse impact on adjoining premises, and 

To minimise release of contaminated materials. 

Controls 

1. 

2. 

Reference is to be made to the requirements in the EPA’s Construction Guidelines. 

All  demolition  work  must  comply  with  the  Australian  Standard  AS2601  -  2001,  The  Demolition  of 

Structures. A detailed work plan shall be prepared by a suitably qualified person in accordance with 

the above. 

3. 

Sound pressure levels emanating from the site must comply with the Interim Guideline for Construction 

Noise (Office of Environment and Heritage). 

4. 

A Waste Management Plan (WMP) is to be submitted with the development application. The WMP 

must include volume or area estimates and information about reuse, recycling and disposal options for 

all types of waste produced on-site, including excavation materials.  

5. 

A dilapidation report may be required to be submitted with a development application for any demolition 

within the zone of influence of any other building. 

2.6  Crime Prevention through Environmental Design 

Principles  of  crime  prevention  through  environmental  design  apply  to  all  forms  of  development  including 

residential,  retail,  commercial,  industrial  developments,  public  buildings,  community  facilities  and  the  public 

domain  including  open  space  and  recreation  areas.  The  design  requirements  apply  to  all  residential  flat 

buildings and medium density developments. Many of the principles are also relevant to single dwelling houses 

and dual occupancies.  

Objectives 

a. 

To ensure that the siting and design of buildings and spaces, through casual surveillance, decreases 

opportunities for crime,  

b. 

To ensure that development encourages people to use streets, parks and other public places without 

fear of personal risk, and 

c. 

To ensure the design of publicly accessible areas (eg parks, footpaths, etc) encourages a sense of 

community ownership of open and public spaces. 

########Page46 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
Controls 

1. 

Buildings should be designed to overlook streets, lanes and other public or communal areas to provide 

casual surveillance. In the case of corner lots habitable windows are also be oriented to overlook the 

side street. 

2. 

The design of all development, in particular, the public domain and community facilities is to enhance 

public surveillance of public streets and open space/conservation areas. 

3. 

For residential development, the use of roller shutters other than garages is not permitted on doors 

and windows facing the street. Any security railings must be designed to complement the architecture 

of the building. 

4. 

5. 

Developments are to avoid creating areas for concealment and blank walls facing the street. 

Pedestrian and communal areas are to have sufficient lighting to ensure a high level of safety. These 

areas must be designed to minimise opportunities for concealment. 

6. 

All development should aim to provide casual surveillance of the street as a means of passive security. 

This  should  be  achieved  by  maximising  outlooks  and  views,  but  minimising  the  overlooking  of 

neighbouring  properties.  Opportunities  for  casual  surveillance  from  dwellings  /  studios  are  to  be 

incorporated into the design of shared driveways and where rear access is proposed from laneways. 

7. 

All developments are to incorporate the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design 

(CPTED). Development applications for subdivision, public open space and community facilities may 

require a formal crime risk (CPTED) assessment. 

2.7  Earthworks 

Objectives  

a. 

To  minimise  cut  and  fill  through  site  sensitive  subdivision,  road  layout,  infrastructure  and  building 

design, 

b. 

To develop finished ground levels that anticipate the siting of buildings so as to minimise the need for 

further modification to ground levels. 

c. 

To consider the extent of earthworks when designing building blocks and lots that minimises use of 

cut and fill, and retaining walls. 

d. 

To  ensure  that  earthworks  do  not  adversely  impact  local  drainage  patterns  or  increase  flooding 

impacts, and 

e. 

To minimise the impacts of earthworks on the natural environment and on the visual character of the 

locality. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page47 

 
 
f. 

To ensure that any imported fill material is not contaminated and does not adversely affect the fertility 

or salinity of soil, or the quality of surface water or groundwater. 

Controls  

1. 

Subdivision and building work is to be designed to respond to the natural topography of the site and 

wherever possible, minimise the extent of cut and fill. 

2. 

Subdivision and building work shall be designed to ensure minimal cut and fill is required for the 

building construction phase of development.  

3. 

The applicant is to demonstrate: 

  what the proposed finished surface levels and gradients will be for the site, 

  how these finished levels are integrated with nearby land, and 

 

that the finished levels are consistent with the drainage strategy contained within the 

overall water cycle strategy for the precinct. 

4. 

Preliminary building pad levels are to be constructed at the subdivision stage of development where 

site slopes exceed 5.0%. 

5. 

All retaining walls on the boundaries of proposed lots are to be identified and proposed as part of the 

respective subdivision development application.  

6. 

The maximum height of retaining walls to be constructed on the boundaries of proposed residential 

lots is 600mm. 

7. 

A combined 1200mm maximum retaining wall height is permissible on a boundary between 

residential lots (2x600mm high retaining walls). Where terraced walls are proposed the minimum 

distance between each step is 1m.  

8. 

A variation to maximum permissible retaining wall heights can be considered with supporting 

justification. 

9. 

Where retaining walls are in proximity to or on property boundaries or adjacent to infrastructure such 

as drainage lines, a section 88B instrument is to create an easement for support on the subject lot 

and adjoining land.  

10. 

All retaining walls that are proposed as part of a subdivision or early works shall be designed by a 

practicing Structural Engineer and be of masonry construction.  

11. 

Retaining walls that front a public place are to be set back to allow screen planting in front of the 

walls.  

12. 

Boundary retaining walls are to be designed and constructed to allow for installation of boundary 

fencing without impact on the structural soundness of the retaining wall and its footings.  

########Page48 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
13. 

Development on land having a natural gradient of 1:6.7 (15%) or greater shall not be approved 

unless a geotechnical study that includes guidelines for structural and engineering works on the land 

has been considered by Council.   

14. 

For sites with existing water storage facilities (dams) the relevant development application must 

include a dam removal plan which addresses each of the following controls to Council’s satisfaction 

and must also  include details of: 

  A water quality and soil test which details any contaminants in both the water and soil at the base 

of the dam (all testing shall be undertaken by a qualified consultant and National Association of 

Testing Authorities accredited laboratory). 

  A  salinity  hazard  test  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  NSW  Office  of  Water  salinity  site 

assessment guidelines. 

12. 

Contaminated sites must follow the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage contaminated water or 

soil removal guidelines in the National Environment Protection (Assessment of Site Contamination) 

Measure 1999.  Contaminated water should be disposed of at a liquid waste facility.  

13. 

Uncontaminated water may be re-used on site or on other properties.  Should there be no possible 

reuse option for the water; a controlled release into the creek may be possible.  

14. 

Any controlled release of water into the receiving waters (creek) must ensure against any erosion 

impact. 

15. 

It is recommended that any water release is undertaken during high flow events as creek water 

quality is reduced at this time. 

16. 

Earth moved from areas containing noxious weed material must be disposed of at an approved 

waste management facility, and transported in compliance with the Noxious Weeds Act 1993. 

17. 

All earthworks should be carried out in accordance with best practice measures for erosion and 

sedimentation control.  

Note: the Council may require specific information to be submitted with development applications that propose 
earthworks.  Applicants should consult with Council to identify information requirements prior to lodgement of 
an application.

3.1  Residential Density and Subdivision 

The Growth Centres are subject to minimum residential density targets as detailed in the Residential Density 

Maps  in  the  SEPP.    This  section  provides  guidance  on  the  typical  characteristics  of  the  residential  density 

target bands. 

Net Residential Density means the net developable area in hectares of the land on which the development is 

situated divided by the number of dwellings proposed to be located on that land.  Net Developable Area means 

the land occupied by the development, including internal streets plus half the width of any adjoining access 

roads that provide vehicular access, but excluding land that is not zoned for residential purposes.  Refer to 

Figure 3-1 and Landcom’s “Residential Density Guide”  and the Department of Planning and Environments’ 

“Dwelling Density Guide” for further information. 

Figure 3-1: Example for calculating Net Residential Density of a subdivision application 

Net Residential Density is an averaging statistic.  The average dwelling density target in the SEPP should be 

achieved across the identified area with a diversity of lot and housing types.  However, this does not mean that 

all  streets  offer  the  same  housing  and  lot  mix.    Built  form  intensity  should  vary  across  a  neighbourhood  in 

response to the place: more intense around centres or fronting parks, less intense in quieter back streets.  In 

lower density areas, there will be a higher proportion of larger lots and suburban streetscapes but there may 

also  be  some  streets  with  an  urban  character.    In  higher  density  areas,  urban  streets  with  more  attached 

housing forms will be more common but there will also be some suburban streetscapes. 

In recognition of different objectives and street characters at varying densities, certain built form controls vary 

by density bands.  Refer to the section Residential Development.

3. 

Residential development in the Environmental Living area, on Figure 3-2: Residential Structure, is to: 

  Consist  primarily  of  single  dwellings  on  larger  lots,  reflecting  the  environmental  sensitivity  and 

visual character of these parts of the Precincts. 

  Emphasise high quality housing design to make the most of the environmental characteristics of 

the surrounding area. 

  Be  designed  and  located  to  minimise  impacts  on  flood  prone  land,  and  risks  to  property  from 

flooding. 

  Avoid impacts on Existing Native Vegetation and other remnant native vegetation. 

  Consider  relationships  to  adjoining  land  uses  including  public  open  space  and  drainage 

infrastructure. 

  Be  designed  to  respond  to  constraints  from  infrastructure  corridors  such  as  electricity  lines, 

underground gas pipelines and any Sydney Catchment Authority infrastructure. 

  Consider views to and from the land and surrounding parts of the Growth Centre. 

4. 

Non-residential development in the residential areas is encouraged where it: 

  Contributes to the amenity and character of the residential area within which it is located. 

  Provides  services,  facilities  or  other  opportunities  that  meet  the  needs  of  the  surrounding 

residential population, and contributes to reduced motor vehicle use. 

  Will not result in detrimental impacts on the amenity and safety of surrounding residential areas, 

including factors such as noise and air quality. 

 

Is of a design that is visually and functionally integrated with the surrounding residential area. 

Note:  The  relevant  Precinct  Plan  permits  certain  non-residential  development  within  the  residential  zones.  
Other parts of this DCP provides more detailed objectives and controls for these types of development.   

3.2  Block and Lot Layout 

Objectives 

a. 

To  establish  a  clear  urban  structure  that  promotes  a  ‘sense  of  neighbourhood’  and  encourages  walking  and 

cycling. 

b. 

c. 

To efficiently utilise land and achieve the target dwelling yield for the relevant Precinct. 

To  emphasise the  natural  attributes  of  the  site and  reinforce  neighbourhood  identity  through  the placement  of 

visible key landmark features, such as parks, squares and landmark buildings. 

d. 

To optimise outlook and proximity to public and community facilities, parks and public transport with increased 

residential density. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page57 

 
 
 
e. 

To  encourage  variety  in  dwelling  size,  type  and  design  to  promote  housing  choice  and  create  attractive 

streetscapes with distinctive characters. 

f. 

g. 

To accommodate a mix of lot sizes and dwelling types across a precinct. 

To establish minimum lot dimensions for different residential dwelling types. 

Controls 

Blocks 

1. 

Residential neighbourhoods are to be focused on elements of the public domain such as a school, 

park, retail, or community facility that are typically within walking distance.  

2. 

Subdivision layout is to create a legible and permeable street hierarchy that responds to the natural 

site topography, the location of existing significant trees and site features, place making opportunities 

and solar design principles. 

3. 

Pedestrian connectivity is to be maximised within and between each residential neighbourhood with a 

particular focus on pedestrian routes connecting to public open space, bus stops and railway stations, 

educational establishments and community/recreation facilities. 

4. 

Street blocks are to be generally a maximum of 250m long and 70m deep.  Block lengths in excess of 

250m  may  be  considered  by  Council  where  pedestrian  connectivity,  stormwater  management  and 

traffic safety objectives are achieved.   In areas  around neighbourhood and  town centres, the  block 

perimeters should generally be a maximum of 520m (typically 190m x 70m) to increase permeability 

and promote walking. 

Lots 

5. 

Minimum lot sizes for each dwelling type will comply with the minimum lot size provisions permitted by 

the Sydney Region Growth Centres SEPP, summarised here as Table 3-2.  In certain density bands, 

variations to some lot sizes may be possible subject to clauses 4.1AD, 4.1AE and 4.1AF in the Sydney 

Region Growth Centres SEPP. 

6. 

Minimum  lot  frontages  applying  to  each  density  band  will  comply  with  Table  3-3.    Lot  frontage  is 

measured at the street facing building line as indicated in Figure 3-4.

Figure 3-4: Measurement of minimum lot widths and lot area 

7. 

A range of residential lot types (area, frontage, depth, zero lot and access) must be provided to ensure 

a mix of housing types and dwelling sizes and to create coherent streetscapes with distinctive garden 

suburban, suburban and urban characters across a neighbourhood. 

8. 

In areas with a minimum residential density of ≤20dw/ha no more than 40% of the total residential lots 

proposed in any one street block may have a frontage of less than 10m wide. Lots subdivided using 

Subdivision Approval Pathway B1 or B2 (Integrated Housing) for attached or abutting dwellings are 

exempt from this control.  

Note: A street block is defined as a portion of a city, town etc., enclosed by (usually four) neighbouring 

and intersecting streets. 

9. 

In density bands ≤ 25dw/Ha, total lot frontage for front accessed lots ≥ 7m and less than 9m should 

not exceed 20% of any block length due to garage dominance and on-street parking impacts. 

10. 

Lots should be rectangular. Where lots are an irregular shape, they are to be large enough and oriented 

appropriately to enable dwellings to meet the controls in this DCP. 

########Page60 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11. 

Where  residential  development  adjoins  land  zoned  RE1  Public  Recreation  or  SP2  Drainage, 

subdivision  is  to  create  lots  for  the  dwelling  and  main  residential  entry  to  front  the  open  space  or 

drainage land. 

12. 

The orientation and configuration  of lots is to be  generally consistent  with the following subdivision 

principles: 

  Smallest  lots  achievable  for  the  given  orientations  fronting  parks  and  open  space  with  the 

larger lots in the back streets; 

  Larger lots on corners; 

  North  to  the  front  lots  are  either  the  widest  or  deepest  lots,  or  lots  suitable  for  residential 

development forms with private open space at the front.  Narrowest lots with north to the rear. 

13. 

Preferred  block  orientation  is  established  by  the  road  layout  on  the  Indicative  Layout  Plan  in  the 

relevant Precinct Schedule.  Optimal lot orientation is east-west, or north-south where the road pattern 

requires.    Exceptions  to  the  preferred  lot  orientation  may  be  considered  where  factors  such  as  the 

layout  of  existing  roads  and  cadastral  boundaries,  or  topography  and  drainage  lines,  prevent 

achievement of the preferred orientation.  

14. 

An alternative lot orientation may be considered where other amenities such as views and outlook over 

open space are available, and providing appropriate solar access and overshadowing outcomes can 

be achieved. 

Note: The combination of the lot frontage width and the size of the lot determine the type of dwelling that can 
be erected on the lot, and the development controls that apply to that dwelling. 

Zero Lot Lines 

15. 

The location of a zero lot line is to be determined primarily by topography and should be on the low 

side  of  the  lot  to  minimise  water  penetration  and  termite  issues.    Other  factors  to  consider  include 

dwelling design, adjoining dwellings, landscape features, street trees, vehicle crossovers and the lot 

orientation as illustrated at Figure 4-7. 

16. 

On all lots where a zero lot line is permitted, the side of the allotment that may have a zero lot alignment 

must be shown on the approved subdivision plan. 

17. 

Where a zero lot line is nominated on an allotment on the subdivision plan, the adjoining (burdened) 

allotment is to include a 900mm easement for single storey zero lot walls and 1200mm for two storey 

zero  lot  walls  to  enable  servicing,  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  adjoining  dwelling.    No 

overhanging  eaves,  gutters  or  services  (including  rainwater  tanks,  hot  water  units,  air-conditioning 

units or the like) of the dwelling on the benefited lot will be permitted within the easement.  Any services 

and  projections  permitted  under  Clause  4.2.4  (6)  within  the  easement  to  the  burdened  lot  dwelling 

should not impede the ability for maintenance to be undertaken to the benefitted lot. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page61 

 
 
18. 

The S88B  instrument for the subject (benefited) lot and the adjoining (burdened) lot shall  include a 

note identifying the potential for a building to have a zero lot line.  The S88B instrument supporting the 

easement is to be worded so that Council is removed from any dispute resolution process between 

adjoining allotments. 

For  more  information,  refer  to  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Environment  Delivery  Notes:  Zero  Lot 

Boundaries and Building Envelope Plans. 

Subdivision of Shallow Lots 

19. 

Shallow lots (typical depth 14-18m, typical area <200sqm) intended for double storey dwellings should 

be  located  only  in  locations  where  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  impacts  on  adjoining  lots,  such  as 

overshadowing and overlooking of private open space, satisfy the requirements of the DCP.  For lots 

over 225sqm where development is not Integrated  Assessment, the Building Envelope Plan should 

demonstrate  in  principle  how  DCP  requirements  such  as  solar  access  and  privacy  to  neighbouring 

private open spaces will be satisfied.  

Subdivision for Attached or Abutting Dwellings 

20. 

Subdivision  of  lots  for  Torrens  title  attached  or  abutting  dwellings  must  take  into  account  that 

construction will be in ‘sets’.  A ‘set’ is a group of attached or abutting dwellings built together at the 

same time that are designed and constructed independently from other dwellings. 

21. 

The maximum number of attached or abutted dwellings permissible in a set is six. 

22. 

The composition of sets needs to be determined in the subdivision design to take into account the lot 

width required for a side setback to the end dwellings in each set.  Examples of lot subdivisions for 

sets are illustrated in Figure 3-5. 

Figure 3-5: Two examples of lot subdivision for ‘sets’ of attached or abutting terraces.

Residential Flat Buildings 

23. 

A person may not amalgamate two or more adjoining allotments after principle subdivision to create a 

larger lot that achieves the minimum lot size required for residential flat buildings.

  Battle-axe lots 

Objectives  

a. 

b. 

To limit battle-axe lots to certain circumstances. 

To ensure that where a battle-axe lot without public road or open space frontage is provided, their amenity and 

the amenity of neighbouring lots is not compromised by their location. 

c. 

To enable battle-axe shaped lots or shared driveway access to lots fronting access denied roads. 

Controls  

1. 

2. 

Principles for the location of battle-axe lots are illustrated at Figure 3-6. 

Subdivision layout should minimise the use of battle-axe lots without public frontage to resolve residual 

land issues.   

Figure 3-6: Examples of locations of battle-axe lots 

3. 

In density bands 10, 15 and 20dw/Ha, the minimum site area for battle-axe lots without any street or 

park frontage  is 500m² (excluding  the shared driveway) and only  detached dwelling houses  will  be 

permitted. 

########Page64

4. 

5. 

The driveway or shared driveway will include adjacent planting and trees, as indicated in Figure 3-7. 

Driveway  design,  including  dimensions  and  corner  splays,  is  to  be  in  accordance  with  Council’s 

Engineering Specifications.

  Corner Lots 

Objectives 

a. 

To ensure corner lots are of sufficient dimensions and size to enable residential controls to be met. 

Controls  

1.  Corner lots, including splays and driveway location, are to be designed in accordance with AS 2890 and 

Council’s Engineering Specifications. 

2.  Corner lots are to be designed to allow dwellings to positively address both street frontages as indicated

purposes. 

Controls 

1. 

The design and construction of streets in East Leppington is to be generally consistent with the relevant 

typical designs in Figure 3-12 to Figure 3-16 and Council’s Engineering Design Guide. 

2. 

All collector roads, sub-arterial roads, arterial roads and local streets which form part of a bus route 

identified by Transport for NSW, are to have at least one travel lane in each direction with a minimum 

width  of  3.5  metres,  suitable  for  buses.   Intersections  on  bus  routes  are  to  be  designed  to 

accommodate bus manoeuvrability. 

3. 

Alternative street designs for local streets and access ways may be permitted on a case by case basis 

if they preserve the functional objectives and requirements of the design standards. 

4. 

Roads in the East Leppington Precinct are to be constructed in accordance with the hierarchy shown 

on the Precinct road hierarchy figure (refer to Figure 3-11). 

5. 

The locations and alignments of all roads are to be generally in accordance with the locations shown 

on the Figure 3-11. 

########Page70 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
6. 

Where any variation to the residential street network indicated at  the Figure 3-11, is proposed, the 

alternative street network is to be designed to: 

 

create a permeable network that is based on a modified grid system, 

  encourage walking and cycling, 

  minimise travel distances for all modes of transport, 

  maximise  connectivity  between  residential  areas  and  community  facilities,  open  space  and 

centres, 

 

take account of topography and site drainage, and accommodate significant vegetation, 

  optimise solar access opportunities for dwellings, 

  provide frontage to and maximise surveillance of open space and drainage lands, 

  provide views and vistas to landscape features and visual connections to nodal points and centres, 

  maximise the effectiveness of water sensitive urban design measures,  

  ensure that noise impacts from major roads are considered and are able to be effectively mitigated 

without the use of noise walls. Should an exception arise the circumstances are to be fully justified 

to the satisfaction of Council. 

 

comply with the requirements of Planning for Bushfire Protection 2006, 

  not detrimentally impact on access to adjoining properties, 

  provide for the management of stormwater to drain to Council’s trunk drainage network, without 

negative impacts on other properties,  

  not impede the orderly development of adjoining properties in accordance with the Campbelltown 

Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington) and this Development Control Plan, and 

  not  restrict  the  ability  to  provide  water,  sewer,  electricity  and  other  essential  services  to  the 

development or to development on adjoining properties.

7. 

For changes to the proposed road system which Council considers minor, Council may write to affected 

property  owners  and  consider  any  comments  of  those  persons  before  determining  the  application.  

Applicants wishing to amend the proposed road pattern are  advised to liaise with affected adjoining 

owners prior to the submission of the development application.  By obtaining the prior agreement of 

adjoining  owners to proposed road pattern changes, the time required by  Council to determine the 

application may be reduced. 

8. 

Where roads are adjacent to public open space or drainage land, or adjacent to arterial and sub-arterial 

roads, the verge width on the side adjacent to the open space, drainage land or major road may, in 

certain circumstances, be reduced to a minimum of 1m, subject to: 

  appropriate arrangements for the provision of public utilities, 

  provision of appropriate pedestrian access, 

########Page74 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
 
 

compliance with road safety, and 

  acoustic attenuation, bushfire asset protection zone, and riparian corridor requirements 

9. 

Where streets are proposed as part of an application for subdivision that are located adjacent to public 

recreation  land, drainage  land, community facilities  or schools, the  applicant  will be responsible for 

construction of the full width of the street, unless Council specifies otherwise. 

10. 

Except where otherwise provided for in this DCP, all streets and roundabouts are to be designed and 

constructed  in accordance  with the minimum requirements set out in Council’s  Engineering  Design 

Guide for Development. Where a corner lot fronts a roundabout, the driveway shall be set back 10m 

from the splay. 

11. 

Split level roads will only be considered where all other alternatives have been exhausted.  

12. 

Residential  roads,  i.e.  collector  roads,  local  streets,  access  road/places,  and  shareways  shall  be 

designed for and sign posted at a maximum of 50kph (i.e. traffic management must be considered at 

the subdivision application, with either road layout or speed reducing devices used to produce a traffic 

environment which reduces traffic speed). 

13. 

Where  four  way  intersections  are  proposed,  traffic  is  to  be  controlled,  where  appropriate,  by  traffic 

lights, roundabouts, median strips or signage. 

14. 

Street trees are required for all streets. Street planting is to: 

  use the preferred species listed in Appendix D. 

  be  consistently  used  to  distinguish  between  public  and  private  spaces  and  between  different 

classes of street within the street hierarchy, 

  minimise risk to utilities and services, 

  be  durable  and  suited  to  the  street  environment  and,  wherever  appropriate,  include  endemic 

species, 

  maintain  adequate  lines of sight for vehicles and  pedestrians,  especially  around driveways  and 

street corners, 

  be located to minimise conflicts between trees and driveways,  

  provide appropriate shade in summer and solar access in winter,  

  provide  an  attractive  and  interesting  landscape  character  and  clearly  define  public  and  private 

areas, without limiting passive surveillance of the street, 

  not interfere with refuse collection and buried utilities, and 

 

consider  items of environmental heritage,  heritage conservation areas,  historic road  alignments 

and significant view lines. 

15. 

Street trees are to be provided with a minimum spacing of one tree for each residential lot, or one tree 

per 10 metres of road, whichever spacing is the greater. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page75 

 
16. 

Street trees may be permitted within the road carriageway subject to the findings of  a Road Safety 

Audit.  

17. 

While acknowledging the amenity benefit from trees within the carriageway, applications that propose 

carriageway trees will be assessed by Council with consideration given to: 

  access and manoeuvrability of garbage trucks, street sweepers and cars,  

 

the impact of the root system on the carriageway and buried utilities;  

  ongoing maintenance of the tree and carriageway;  

 

 

the relationship with future driveway access points; and 

traffic safety. 

18. 

Signage, street furniture and lighting is to be: 

  designed to reinforce the distinct identity of the development; 

 

 

 

coordinated in design and style; 

located so as to minimise visual clutter and obstruction of the public domain; and 

consistent with any landscaping and public domain guidelines or policies specified by Council. 

19. 

Locating entry signage and the like within a public road reserve is subject to Council agreement. 

20. 

The location and design of signage and street furniture is to be indicated on the Landscape Plan and 

on engineering construction drawings. 

21. 

Street lighting is to be designed to meet the current Australian Standards AS/NZS 1158 series. 

22. 

Access streets (refer to Figure 3-15) may be used where: 

  The access street separates residential land from open space or drainage land or is adjacent to 

an arterial road, sub-arterial road or transit boulevard. 

  The road is not a through traffic route (ie. it provides access only to residences on it). 

  A maximum of 10 dwellings, between each intersection with another public road, have a frontage 

and vehicular access to the access street. 

  Adequate provision can be made for garbage trucks and other commercial vehicles 

23. 

Access streets are to intersect with local roads only. 

24. 

Where an access street has frontage to open space or drainage land, the footpath is to be constructed 

as part of the access street, and located within the verge adjacent to the open space or drainage land.   

25. 

Where the access street is adjacent to a sub-arterial road and/or arterial road, the footpath is to be 

located within the verge adjacent to the residential development.

Noise Attenuation 

26. 

Noise attenuation is to be appropriately screened by native, low maintenance, landscape planting. 

27. 

Where noise attenuation includes a structure, in addition to vegetation, the use of natural materials 

including gabions, stone, timber or similar is preferred. 

28. 

Council may consider alternative, innovative noise attenuation measures that comply with the relevant 

Australian Standard and any other relevant agency guidelines. 

29. 

Noise walls are not preferred. 

30. 

Noise  attenuation,  where  required,  shall  be  in  place  prior  to  the  occupation  of  any  dwelling  in  the 

Precinct. 

Noise Attenuation Camden Valley Way 

In addition to the above, the following apply specifically to development adjoining Camden Valley Way: 

31. 

Development adjacent to and along Camden Valley Way will require appropriate noise attenuation.  

32. 

The design of the acoustic and landscape treatment to Camden Valley Way is to take into account 

the existing underground gas pipeline.  

Note: Section 6.6 of this DCP should also be considered. 

Utilities  

33. 

Development within and adjacent to the easement must be referred to the relevant utility provider 

(Jemena, Gorodok or any other provider) for approval prior to any works being commenced, and 

evidence of the utility provider’s agreement must be submitted with the development application. 

34. 

Development and use of land within the easement is restricted by the conditions of the easement and 

applicants should demonstrate compliance with any restrictions imposed by the easement when 

submitting applications for development.   

35. 

To the satisfaction of the utility provider, landscaping (including tree planting), other than 

groundcover, is not permitted within 5m of the pipelines. 

36. 

At the subdivision stage any utility cross connections over roads should be identified.  

37. 

An indicative design for the collector road in proximity to the gas easements is shown Figure 6-14.  

Note: Section 6.5 Land adjacent to or affected by a Gas Easement should also be considered. 

Historic Tree Row - Leppington House 

38. 

 The Historic Tree Row identified in Figure 3-11 and Figure 3-17 shall be incorporated into the public 

road reserve wherever possible.  Where trees cannot be retained, they are to be replaced by new 

planting, spaced at similar intervals to maintain the historic and heritage integrity of these cultural 

landscape elements.  

39. 

An Arborist Assessment shall be prepared by a suitably qualified professional and is to be submitted 

with any Subdivision Application involving development adjacent to any of the trees identified in the 

Historic Tree Row.  The assessment shall include: 

########Page78 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
  Evaluation of the viability  and safety  of incorporating the trees within a road reserve, the public 

domain or within appropriate setbacks on individual lots; 

  Recommendations for their retention, conservation, supplementation and/or reinstatement; 

 

Identification of protection measures for the retention of trees during adjacent construction works; 

and 

  Recommendations for their maintenance regime. 

Other trees   

40. 

Other significant individual trees and tree rows are encouraged to be retained in the design of the 

public domain and the location of dwellings. The matters for consideration will include the health, 

species, size and viability of the tree along with other relevant matters determined by Council. 

Note: Section 6.2 provides controls important to the Historic Tree Row and other significant plantings.

  Laneways 

Laneways are public roads that are shareways, utilitarian throughways of the street network that provide rear 

vehicular  access  to  compact  or  restricted  access  lots.    The  primary  purpose  of  rear  laneways  is  to  create 

attractive front residential streets by removing garages and driveway cuts from the street frontages, improving 

the  presentation  of  houses  and  maximising  on  street  parking  spaces  and  street  trees.    Laneways  are  a 

‘sacrificial’  network  device:  while  they  should  be  neat  and  tidy,  they  should  not  be  confused  with  streets  in 

width, character or function. 

A laneway is a shareway, designed to be shared by all users whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers.  

Equal priority between all users reinforces the distinctive, slow speed environment for drivers. 

In their design and subdivision of lots, laneways should be provided with casual surveillance from some second 

floor rooms and balconies over garages.  Various building forms can provide this casual surveillance along the 

lane such as studio dwellings, secondary dwellings and rooms of the principal dwelling or lofts over garages.  

Separate titling of studio dwellings may affect servicing requirements.  Generally there will be no underground 

services in the laneway (except for streetlights) as the studios will be strata titled so power, water, gas, sewer 

and communications will be located in the front street and reticulated from the  front of the allotment through 

the lot to the rear studio. 

Objectives  

a. 

To provide vehicular access to the rear or side of lots where front access is restricted or not possible, 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

g. 

particularly narrow lots where front garaging is not permitted. 

To reduce garage dominance in residential streets. 

To maximise on-street parking spaces and landscaping in residential streets. 

To provide opportunities for affordable housing options. 

To reduce vehicular conflict through reduced driveway cross overs and focusing of traffic to known 

points. 

To enable garbage collection. 

To facilitate the use of attached and narrow lot housing to achieve overall higher neighbourhood 

densities. 

h. 

To create a slow speed shared zone requiring co-operative driving practices for the very low volume 

and frequency of vehicle movements that is distinctly different in character and materials to 

residential streets. 

Controls 

1. 

The  design  and  construction  of  laneways  is  to  be  consistent  with  Figure  3-18  and  Department  of 

Planning and Environment Delivery Note: Laneways. 

########Page80 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
Typical Laneway section 

Typical Laneway (plan) 

Figure 3-18: Laneway principles 

2. 

The laneway is a public “shareway” as the paved surface is for cyclists, pedestrians, garbage collection, 

mail deliveries, cars etc, with a 10 km speed limit and driveway-style crossovers to the street rather 

than a road junction. 

3. 

The minimum garage doorway widths for manoeuvrability in this laneway section are 2.4m (single) and 

4.8m (double). 

4. 

The configuration of the laneway,  associated subdivision and  likely  arrangement of garages  arising 

from  that  subdivision  should  create  ordered,  safe  and  tidy  laneways  by  designing  out  ambiguous 

spaces and unintended uses such as casual parking, the storage of trailers, bin stacking etc. 

5. 

The  layout  of  laneways  should  take  into  account  subdivision  efficiency,  maximising  favourable  lot 

orientations,  intersection  locations  with  streets,  topography,  opportunities  for  affordable  housing, 

legibility and passive surveillance. 

  Generally, straight layouts across the block are preferred for safety and legibility, but the detailed 

alignment can employ subtle bends or secondary or studio dwellings over garages to add visual 

interest and avoid long distance monotonous views.  “C” shaped layouts with the laneway length 

parallel to the front street can limit the views of laneways from residential streets to short sections.  

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page81 

 
 
 
 
 
 
However, if the laneway is used for garbage collection, any bends or intersections are to be sized 

for garbage truck movements.  Suggested layouts are in Figure 3-19. 

  Lanes  on  sloping  land  with  significant  longitudinal  and/or  cross  falls  require  detailed  design 

consideration to demonstrate functionality. 

Figure 3-19: Sample lane layouts 

6. 

Laneways that create a ‘fronts to backs’ layout (front addressed principle dwellings on one side and 

rear accessed garages on the other side) are to be avoided. 

7. 

8. 

All lots adjoining a laneway should utilise the laneway for vehicular/garage access. 

Passive  surveillance  along  the  laneway  from  the  upper  storey  rooms  or  balconies  of  secondary 

dwellings, studio dwellings, principal dwelling or lofts over rear garages is encouraged.  Ground floor 

habitable rooms on laneways are to be avoided unless they are located on external corners (laneway 

with a street) and face the street to take advantage of the residential street for an address, shown in 

Figure 3-20 as lane entry/street corner lots.  Figure 3-20 indicates mid-lane lots and internal corner 

locations (lane with another lane) where ground floor habitable rooms in secondary dwellings or strata 

studios (marked ‘S’) are to be avoided.  

9. 

A continuous run of secondary dwellings or strata studios along the lane is to be avoided, as it changes 

the  character,  purpose  and  function  of  the  lane.    No  more  than  25%  of  the  lots  adjoining  lanes 

(excluding street corner lots with studio at the lane entry) are to have secondary dwellings or strata 

studios.  See Figure 3-20. 

10. 

All lot boundaries adjoining the lane are to be defined by fencing or built form.  The garage setback to 

the lane is minimal (0.5m) to allow overhanging eaves or balconies to remain in the lot without creating 

spaces  where  people  park  illegally  in  front  of  garages  and/or  on  the  laneway.    Deeper  balconies 

requiring larger garage setbacks (up to 2m) may be permitted occasionally along the laneway provided 

########Page82 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
the application demonstrates how the setback space will not create an opportunity for illegal parking, 

such as the presence of a supporting post or bollard.

  Shared Driveways 

Shared driveways are privately owned and maintained driveways that serve two or more dwellings through a 

titling  arrangement  such  as  a  reciprocal  right  of  way  or  community  title.    Shared  driveways  are  usually  of 

minimal  dimensions  for  vehicle  access  to  lots  with  only  a  single  access  to  the  street  network.    Garbage 

collection is usually not a function.  Shared driveways are a useful subdivision device for a small number of 

dwellings with otherwise difficult access or unavoidable block configurations, but are not a substitute in blocks 

designed with significant numbers of dwellings requiring rear access by laneways. 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To minimise the impact of vehicle access points on the quality of the public domain and pedestrian safety. 

To provide safe and convenient access to garages, carports and parking areas. 

To clearly define public and private spaces, such that driveways are for the sole use of residents. 

To permit casual surveillance of private driveways from dwellings and from the street. 

CONTROLS 

1. 

Shared driveways are to be constructed as one of three general types, depending on block geometry 

and garages to be accessed. Refer to examples in Figure 3-21.   

2. 

Shared driveways are to have the smallest configuration possible to serve the required parking facilities 

and vehicle turning movements. 

3. 

The driveway crossing the verge between the property boundary and the kerb is to have a maximum 

width of 5.4 metres. 

4. 

The location of driveways is to  be determined with regard to dwelling design and orientation, street 

gully pits and tree bays and is to maximise the available on-street parking. 

5. 

The  maximum  travelling  distance  from  a  public  road  to  a  garbage  collection  area  within  a  shared 

driveway is 70m.  Where garbage collection is required to occur within the shared driveway (i.e. when 

an  alternative  collection  point  is  not  available),  the  layout  is  to  be  designed  such  that  no  reversing 

movements are required to be undertaken to enable a garage truck  to enter and leave in a forward 

direction. A minimum pavement width of 5m and a turning circle with sweep turning paths overlaid into 

the design plan shall be submitted to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. 

6. 

Access to allotments in the vicinity of roundabouts and associated splinter islands shall not be provided 

within 10m of the roundabout. 

7. 

8. 

9. 

Driveways are not to be within 0.5m of any drainage facilities on the kerb and gutter. 

Shared driveways are to have soft landscaped areas on either side, suitable for infiltration. 

Shared  driveways  must  be  in  accordance  with  the  shareway  principles  and  vehicle  manoeuvring

  Temporary vehicular access 

Objectives 

a. 

To  enable  development  to  progressively  occur  in  Precincts  where  current  land  ownership  or  other 

development staging constraints  temporarily  limit road access to properties  in  accordance  with this 

DCP, 

b. 

To ensure that appropriate vehicular access to properties is provided and maintained at all times during 

the development of the Precincts, and 

c. 

To ensure that temporary vehicular access arrangements do not compromise safety and the efficient 

operation of the road network. 

Controls 

10. 

Where  necessary  to  ensure  that  access  to  residential  properties  is  provided  in  the  early  stages  of 

development, Council may consent to the construction and operation of temporary access roads. 

11. 

Temporary  access  arrangements  must  comply  with  Council’s  Engineering  Design  Guide  for 

Development. 

12. 

Temporary access roads are to remain in operation only until such time as the road network has been 

developed to provide permanent access to all properties. 

13. 

The plan of subdivision is to show the location and design of temporary access roads, and the means 

of transitioning to permanent access arrangements 

Note: Specific controls in Section 3.4.6 apply to temporary access to arterial roads and sub-arterial roads. 

14. 

Temporary turning circles will be required where roads are to continue onto adjoining properties that 

are not yet developed.  Temporary turning circles are to have a minimum radius of 8 metres and are 

to be sealed using the same materials as the rest of the road. 

15. 

Half-width  roads  may  be  constructed  to  provide  temporary  access  to  residential  development,  in 

accordance  with  Figure  3-23.  The  applicant  will  cover  all  costs  associated  with   the  design 

of  

the  

full  

road  width  and  construction  of  half  

the full  width  pavement,  

including 

adequate   transitions   to  full  width  cross  sections,  plus  a   two  way   traffic  configuration  ensuring 

operational effectiveness and safety  to relevant standards. 

16. 

Half-width roads are only permitted where the road is located on the side boundary of the land to be 

developed.   

17. 

The centreline (of the full-width road) is to be located on the boundary. 

18. 

Where a half-width road terminates temporarily at the rear of a development, adequate arrangements 

for vehicles to turn (such as turning T heads or turning circles) must be shown on the plan of subdivision 

and the application must demonstrate how the transition to permanent arrangements will be managed. 

19. 

The half-width road design is to ensure that runoff from the road pavement is directed to the kerb. 

########Page88 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
20. 

The development application plans are to show the vertical alignment of the half-width road relative to 

natural ground level on the adjoining property, and the applicant is to demonstrate how the half-width 

road will be integrated with adjoining land. 

21. 

A minimum carriageway width of 6 metres is required for all half-width roads.

  Access to arterial roads and sub-arterial roads 

Objectives 

a. 

To restrict direct property access to higher order roads to provide for the safe and efficient movement 

of vehicles on these roads. 

Controls 

1. 

Vehicular access to arterial roads or sub-arterial roads shown on the Precinct Road Hierarchy figure 

(refer to Figure 3-11) may only be via another public road. 

2. 

To enable the development of land, such as in situations where access across adjoining properties is 

required but not yet able to be provided,  Council may allow temporary access to arterial roads or  sub-

arterial roads where: 

 

subdivisional roads generally conform with the road pattern shown on the Indicative Layout Plan 

and  the  development  is  capable  of  being  adapted  to  ensure  alternative  access  when  adjacent 

development occurs; 

  The arterial road or sub-arterial road is not yet upgraded to its ultimate configuration and/or traffic 

volumes on the road network are not sufficient to justify restricting direct access; 

  Council is satisfied that the carrying out of the development will not compromise traffic safety. 

3. 

Where Council grants such consent, the temporary access must be constructed to Council's standards 

and conditions will be imposed that access to the designated road by way of the temporary access 

shall cease when alternative access becomes available. 

Note: Approval from the RMS may also be required for any temporary access to a classified road. 

3.5  Open Space Network 

The open space network for East Leppington Precinct is shown in Figure 3-24 and within the Campbelltown 

Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington). 

Objectives 

The objectives for the Open Space network in East Leppington Precinct include: 

a. 

To establish an open space network  focused on the Bonds Creek and Bonds Creek South riparian 

corridor that provides for the passive and active recreation needs of the local community, 

b. 

To  retain  and  enhance  significant  stands  of  remnant  vegetation  within  the  open  space  network 

wherever possible, 

c. 

To provide appropriate tree planting within key road corridors,

3.6  Construction Environmental Management 

Objectives 

a. 

To ensure that the construction of subdivisions, new buildings and other structures and works is done 

in an environmentally responsible manner. 

Controls 

1. 

A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) is to be submitted to Council or the accredited 

certifier and approved prior to the issue of a construction certification for subdivision. 

2. 

The CEMP is to detail the methods of ensuring the protection of the environment during construction, 

monitoring and reporting on construction activities, and procedures to be followed in the event of an 

incident that is likely to cause harm to the environment. 

3. 

Construction  activities  are  to  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  water  quality,  soil  stability,  trees  and 

vegetation cover, and heritage sites are protected in accordance with the development consent and to 

maintain the quality of the natural environment. 

4. 

Applicants are to ensure that the management of construction activities is undertaken in accordance 

with Campbelltown Council Engineering Design Guide for Development and the Blue Book. 

5. 

Preservation  of  trees  and  native  vegetation  during  construction  is  to  be  in  accordance  with  the 

development consent issued for the development, and with the native vegetation and tree preservation 

provisions of the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington). 

6. 

Trees to be protected must be enclosed within a 1.8m high protection fence installed to conform to a 

Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) that is consistent with current arboriculture industry standards.  

7. 

A  report  which  outlines  the  condition,  dimensions  and  species  of  existing  trees  contained  within  a 

development  site  is  to  be  included  as  part  of  any  development  application  documents  and  is  to  be 

accompanied  by  a  Tree  Retention  Management  Plan  which  shows  the  dimension  of  any  proposed 

TPZs and outlines any other protection/enhancement methods that are appropriate to encourage the 

viable retention of trees.  

8. 

All reports pertaining to trees on development sites are to be prepared by a suitably qualified person.

This  part  of  the  DCP  establishes  the  objectives  and  controls  that  guide  residential  development,  including 

residential design controls for dwelling houses, attached or abutting dwellings, semi detached dwellings, multi 

unit housing, secondary dwellings, studio dwellings, dual occupancies, residential flat building, manor homes 

and shop top housing.  This part also covers residential amenity controls such as streetscape, safety, visual 

and acoustic privacy, sustainable building design, fencing, waste management and site services. 

4.1  Site Responsive Design 

  Site Analysis 

Site analysis for each individual lot is an important part of the design process. Development proposals need to 

illustrate design decisions which are based on careful analysis of the site conditions and their relationship to 

the surrounding context. By describing the physical elements of the locality and the conditions impacting on 

the site, opportunities and constraints for development can be understood and addressed in the design.  

The Site Analysis Plan should show the existing features of the site and its surrounding area, together with 

supporting written material.  At a minimum the Site Analysis Plan must show the following features: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the position of the proposed building in relation to site boundaries and any other structures and existing 

vegetation and trees on the site; 

any easements over the land; 

the location, boundary dimensions, site area and north point of the land; 

location of existing street features adjacent to the property, such as trees, planting, street lights; 

contours and existing levels of the land in relation to buildings and roads;  

whether the proposed development will involve any changes to existing site levels;  

location and uses of buildings on sites adjoining the land; and 

a stormwater concept plan (where required). 

  Cut and fill 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

To minimise the extent of cut and fill within residential allotments, 

To ensure that fill material is not contaminated and does not adversely affect the fertility or salinity of 

soil, or the quality of surface water or groundwater, and 

c. 

To  ensure  that  the  amenity  of  adjoining  residential  development  is  not  adversely  affected  by 

earthworks. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page97 

 
 
Controls 

1. 

Development  applications  relating  to  land  within  residential  zones  are  to  illustrate  where  necessary 

further to cut and/or fill is required  and provide justification for the proposed changes to the  ground 

levels.  

2. 

Earthworks for dwelling construction (apart from earthworks completed as part of approved subdivision 

and/or early works) may be undertaken to a maximum of 500mm excavation or fill as measured from 

the sites existing ground levels. 

3. 

Retaining walls are not to be constructed on side or rear boundaries of lots unless these are already 

approved as part of any previous subdivision or early works development application. 

4. 

Retaining walls are to be located at least 900mm from side or rear lot boundaries and 1m from any 

registered easement (main) for sewer and water. 

5. 

Council will assess proposals for excavation or fill greater than 500mm having regard to visual impacts, 

impacts on drainage and potential impacts on soil salinity and stability.  

6. 

A Validation Report is required to be submitted to Council prior to the placement of imported fill on site. 

All fill shall comply with the NSW Office of Water – “Site Investigation for Urban Salinity” and the OEH 

Contaminated Sites Guidelines – “Guidelines for the NSW Site Auditor Scheme (2nd edition)  – Soil 

Investigation Levels for Urban Development Sites in NSW”. 

7. 

On significantly sloping sites, site disturbance is to be minimised by use of split level or pier foundation 

dwelling designs. Council will consider greater cut for basement garages. 

8. 

Where cut or fill is proposed on the boundary of a lot, retaining walls are to be constructed with side 

fence posts integrated with its construction (relevant construction details are required with retaining 

wall approval). Otherwise retaining walls must be located a minimum of 450mm from the side or rear 

boundary of the lot containing the cut or fill. 

9. 

Retaining  walls  within  residential  lots  are  to  be  no  greater  than  600mm  high  and  be  of  masonry 

construction. 

10. 

The maximum height of building voids within individual lots is 3m, as illustrated in Figure 4-1.

To enhance streetscape amenity and ensure an appropriate standard of landscaping, 

To  minimise  energy  usage  and  greenhouse  emissions  and  encourage  the  adoption  of  renewable 

energy initiatives, 

d. 

To  minimise  consumption  of  potable  water  for  non-potable  uses,  minimise  site  runoff  and  promote 

stormwater re-use, and 

e. 

To  minimise  the  use  of  non-renewable  resources  and  minimise  the  generation  of  waste  during 

construction. 

Controls 

1.

apartments intended, or capable of being, strata titled are to be accompanied by a BASIX Certificate 

and are to incorporate all commitments stipulated in the BASIX Certificate. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

Indigenous species are encouraged. 

A landscape plan is to be submitted with every application for multi-dwelling housing and residential flat 

buildings.  

The provisions of BASIX will apply with regards to water requirements and usage. 

The design of dwellings is to maximise cross flow ventilation. 

The positioning and size of windows and other openings is to take advantage of solar orientation to 

maximise natural light penetration to indoor areas and to minimise the need for mechanical heating 

and cooling. 

7. 

Outdoor clothes lines and drying areas are required for all dwellings and can be incorporated into areas 

for multi-dwelling development and residential flat building developments. 

8. 

9. 

Design and construction of dwellings is to make use of locally sourced materials where possible. 

Residential building design is to use, where possible, recycled and renewable materials.

  Salinity 

Objectives 

a. 

To manage and mitigate the impacts of, and on, salinity. 

Controls  

1. 

2. 

All development must comply with the Salinity Management Plan at Appendix C. 

Salinity shall be considered during the siting, design and construction of dwellings including: drainage, 

vegetation type and location, foundation selection and cut and fill activities, to ensure the protection of 

the dwelling from salinity damage and to minimise the impacts that the development may have on the 

salinity process. 

3. 

In salinity prone areas materials for pipe infrastructure, foundations and brickwork must have sulphate 

resistant properties to cope with the saline conditions.

4.2  Dwelling design controls 

Under the provisions of the Precinct Plan, development consent is generally required for all dwellings in all 

residential  zones,  except  where  applications  meet  the  criteria  for  complying  development.      This  section 

establishes  objectives  and  controls  for  the  following  types  of  residential  accommodation  as  defined  in  the 

Growth Centres SEPP: 

 

 



residential flat buildings; 

secondary dwellings; and 

studio dwellings. 

Additional controls for attached or abutting dwellings, secondary dwellings, studio dwellings, dual occupancies, 

multi-dwelling housing, manor homes, residential flat buildings and shop top housing are contained in Section 

4.3. 

It  is  acknowledged  that  innovative  dwelling  designs  are  evolving  particularly  on  lots  <300sqm,  and  design 

solutions may be developed that meet the objectives but do not comply with the relevant controls.  In density 

bands ≥25dw/Ha, there is the opportunity to vary the dwelling design controls where agreed to as part of an 

integrated housing development application at subdivision approval.  . 

Note: Reference should be made to the Glossary for descriptions of the various dwelling types, and to the 
relevant Precinct Plan for statutory definitions of land uses.

  Streetscape and architectural design 

Growth Centres neighbourhoods will be composed of a variety of streets with different but equally appealing 

characters and built form intensity.  In low density precincts, suburban streetscapes will be most common but 

there will also be some streets with a more urban village character.  In higher density precincts, urban village 

streets will be more common but there will also be some suburban streetscapes.  The objective is to avoid a 

monoculture of the one type of street which is neither a successful suburban or urban street. 

Figure 4-2 illustrates how the designed combination of built form, lot size, setbacks, garaging and landscaping 

can create distinctive streetscape characters ranging from the low intensity ‘garden suburban’ character based 

on landscaped private space around buildings to the built form intensity and public landscapes of urban streets.

Objectives 

a. 

To  ensure  that  buildings  are  designed  to  enhance  the  built  form  and  character  of  the  neighbourhood  by 

encouraging innovative and quality designs that contribute to unified streetscapes.   

b. 

c. 

d. 

To encourage a diversity of house types.  

To provide a clear distinction between private and public space and to encourage casual surveillance of the street. 

To  reinforce  significant  street  intersections  particularly  on  open  space  and  other  key  strategic  areas  through 

articulation of corner buildings. 

Controls 

1. 

The primary street facade of a dwelling should address the street and must incorporate at least two of 

the following design features: 

  entry feature or porch; 

  awnings or other features over windows; 

  balcony treatment to any first floor element; 

 

recessing or projecting architectural elements; 

  open verandah; 

  bay windows or similar features; or 

 

verandahs, pergolas or similar features above garage doors. 

2. 

Corner lot development should emphasise the corner.  The secondary street facade for a dwelling on 

a corner lot should address the street and must incorporate at least two of the above design features.  

Landscaping  in  the  front  setback  on  the  main  street  frontage  should  also  continue  around  into  the 

secondary setback. 

3. 

Modulation  of  the  façade  should  be  integral  to  the  design  of  the  building,  rather  than  an  unrelated 

attached element. 

4. 

Eaves  are  to  provide  sun  shading  and  protect  windows  and  doors  and  provide  aesthetic  interest. 

Except for walls built to the boundary, eaves should have a minimum of 450mm overhang (measured 

to the fascia board). Council will consider alternative solutions to eaves so long as appropriate sun 

shading is provided to windows and display a high level of architectural merit. 

5. 

The pitch of hipped and gable roof forms on the main dwelling house should be between 22.5 degrees 

and 35 degrees. Skillion roofs, roofs hidden from view by parapet walls, roofs on detached garages, 

studios and ancillary buildings on the allotment are excluded from this control. 

6. 

7. 

Front facades are to feature at least one habitable room with a window onto the street. 

Carports and garages are to be constructed of materials that complement the colour and finishes of 

the main dwelling. 

8. 

Streets  should  be  fronted  with  similar  housing  types  to  create  a  consistent  street  character.    For 

example, a ‘garden suburban’ street character will be created where most dwellings are detached on 

########Page112 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
lot widths ≥15m, perhaps with deeper lots allowing for larger front setbacks and generous landscaping 

around dwellings.  A suburban street character will be created where most dwellings are front loaded, 

detached or zero lotted on lot widths between 9-15m.  An urban street character will be created where 

most  dwellings  are  zero  lotted,  attached/abutting  on  lot  widths  less  than  9m  with  rear  garages.  

Streetscape design principles are illustrated at Figure 4-3.

  Front setbacks 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

To enable the integration of built and landscape elements to create an attractive, visually consistent streetscape. 

To encourage simple and articulated building forms. 

To ensure garages do not dominate the streetscape. 

Controls 

1. 

Dwellings are to be consistent with the front setback controls and principles in the relevant Table 4-2 

2. 

3. 

toTable 4-6, Figure 4-4 and Figure 4-5. 

On corner lots, front setback controls are to be consistent with Figure 4-6. 

To achieve a desired streetscape character, the building façade front setback for a series of lots can 

be more or less than the setbacks shown in  Table 4-2 toTable 4-6 where agreed to as part of the 

preparation of a Building Envelopes Plan or integrated housing development application at subdivision 

approval and the front setbacks are attached to the lot titles.  However, the front setback to garages 

must be a minimum of 5.5m. 

4. 

Elements permitted in the articulation zone (shown on Figure 4-4, Figure 4-5 & Figure 4-6 ) include 

those items listed in Control 4.2.2 (1). 

5. 

Except for rear loaded garages, garages are to be setback at least 5.5m from the street boundary and 

at least 1m behind the building line of the dwelling.

  Side and rear setbacks 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To create an attractive and cohesive streetscape that responds to the character areas. 

To minimise the impacts of development on neighbouring properties. 

To provide appropriate separation between buildings. 

To create opportunities for articulation on the side walls. 

Controls 

1. 

All development is to be consistent with the side and rear setback controls in the relevant  Table 4-2 

toTable 4-6 and principles in Figure 4-7. 

2. 

The location of a zero lot line (Side A) is to be determined primarily by topography and should be on 

the  low  side  of  the  lot  to  minimise  water  penetration  and  termite  issues.    Other  factors  to  consider 

include dwelling design, adjoining dwellings, landscape features, street trees, vehicle crossovers and 

the lot orientation as illustrated at Figure 4-7.   

3. 

For attached or semi-detached dwellings the side setback only applies to the end of a row of attached 

housing, or the detached side of a semi-detached house. 

4. 

Pergolas, swimming pools and other landscape features/structures are permitted to encroach into the 

rear setback. 

5. 

The minimum setback to dwellings from a side boundary that adjoins Public Recreation or Drainage 

land shall be: 

  3m in the R2, R3 and R4 zones. 

  4.5m in the Environmental Living zone.  

6. 

For dwellings with a minimum 900mm side setback, projections permitted into side and rear setback 

areas include eaves (up to 450 millimetres wide), fascias, sun hoods, gutters, down pipes, flues, light 

fittings, electricity or gas meters, rainwater tanks and hot water units. 

7. 

No overhanging eaves, gutters or services (including rainwater tanks, hot water units, air-conditioning 

units or the like) of the dwelling on the benefited lot will be permitted within the easement.  Any services 

and projections  permitted  under  Clause 4.2.4 (6)  within the  easement to the burdened  lot  dwelling 

should not impede the ability for maintenance to be undertaken to the benefitted lot.

8. 

For battle-axe lots without a street facing elevation setbacks are to be determined in the context of 

surrounding lots, built form and the location  of private open space.  An example is shown in Figure 

4-8. 

9. 

The upper floor of dwellings on battle-axe lots must be setback so as not to impact adversely on the 

existing or future amenity of any adjoining land on which residential development is permitted, having 

regard to overshadowing, visual impact and privacy. 

10. 

For a battle-axe lot with direct frontage to land zoned for a public purpose or a street facing elevation 

(such as access denied lots), the front setback controls in Section 4.2.4 are to apply to the lot boundary 

adjoining  the  public  purpose  zone,  and  side  and  rear  setbacks  are  to  apply  to  lot  boundaries 

determined relative to the front setback boundary as shown in Figure 4-9. 

11. 

For corner lots  ≥ 15m lot  width  with shallow  depths  (ie. approximately square  corner lots), the rear 

setback can be varied to be consistent with the side setbacks provided the minimum open space and 

solar access requirements to the proposed and adjoining properties are met.

residential  development  is  permitted,  having  regard  to  overshadowing,  visual  impact  and  any 

impact on privacy; or 

 

the third storey is within the roof line of the building (i.e. an attic). 

Note: Reference should be made to clause 4.3 of the relevant Precinct Plan for statutory height limits. 

2. 

All development is to comply with the maximum site coverage as indicated  in the relevant Table 4-2 

toTable 4-6. 

3. 

Site coverage is the proportion of the lot covered by a dwelling house and all ancillary development 

(e.g. carport, garage, shed) but excluding unenclosed balconies, verandahs, porches, al fresco areas 

etc. 

4. 

5. 

The ground floor level shall be no more than 1m above finished ground level. 

Dwellings on a battle-axe-lot without public open space or street frontage are to be a maximum of 2 

storeys high. 

########Page122

  Landscaped Area 

Landscaped area is defined as an area of open space on the lot, at ground level, that is permeable and consists 

of soft landscaping, turf or planted areas and the like. 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To encourage the use of native flora species and low maintenance landscaping. 

To contribute to effective stormwater management, management of micro-climate impacts and energy efficiency. 

To ensure a balance between built and landscaped elements in residential areas. 

To create the desired street character. 

Controls 

1. 

The  minimum  soft  landscaped  area  within  any  residential  lot  is  to  comply  with  the  controls  and 

principles  in  the  relevant  Table  4-2  toTable  4-6.    Figure  4-10  illustrates  areas  of  a  lot  that  can 

contribute towards the provision of soft landscaped area and principal private open space. 

2. 

Plans submitted  with the development application must indicate the extent  of landscaped area  and 

nominate the location of any trees to be retained or planted. 

3. 

4. 

Surface water drainage shall be provided as necessary to prevent the accumulation of water. 

Use of low flow watering devices is encouraged to avoid over watering. Low water demand drought 

resistant vegetation is to be used for the majority of landscaping, including native salt tolerant trees.

  Private Open Space 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

To provide a high level of residential amenity with opportunities for outdoor recreation and relaxation. 

To enhance the spatial quality, outlook, and usability of private open space. 

To facilitate solar access to the living areas and private open spaces of the dwelling. 

Controls 

1. 

Each dwelling is to be provided with an area of Principal Private Open Space (PPOS) consistent with 

the requirements of the relevant Table 4-2 toTable 4-6. 

2. 

The  location  of  PPOS  is  to  be  determined  having  regard  to  dwelling  design,  allotment  orientation, 

adjoining dwellings, landscape features, topography. 

3. 

The PPOS is required to be conveniently accessible from the main living area of a dwelling or alfresco 

room and have a maximum gradient of 1:10. Where part or all of the PPOS is permitted as a semi-

private patio, balcony or rooftop area, it must be directly accessible from a living area. 

4. 

Open space at the front of the dwelling can only be defined as PPOS where this is the only means of 

achieving the solar access requirements of control 1 above. PPOS at the front of a dwelling must be 

designed  to  maintain  appropriate  privacy  (for  example  raised  level  above  footpath  or  fencing  or 

hedging) and be consistent with the streetscape design controls in Section 4.2.2.

surveillance of private driveways from dwellings and from the street. 

c. 

d. 

To minimise conflict between pedestrians and vehicles at the junction of driveways and footpaths. 

To provide predominantly on-site parking for residents. 

Controls 

1. 

2. 

3. 

1-2 bedroom dwellings will provide at least 1 car space.  

3 bedroom or more dwellings will provide at least 2 car spaces. 

At least one car parking space must be located behind the building façade line where the car parking 

space is accessed from the street on the front property boundary. 

Note: A car space may include a garage, carport or other hard stand area constructed of materials suitable for 
car  parking  and  access.    The  required  car  parking  spaces  specified  above  may  be  provided  using  a 
combination of these facilities, including use of the driveway (within the property boundary only) as a parking 
space. 

4. 

Vehicular  access  is  to  be  integrated  with  site  planning  from  the  earliest  stages  of  the  project  to 

eliminate/reduce  potential  conflicts  with  the  streetscape  requirements  and  traffic  patterns,  and  to 

minimise potential conflicts with pedestrians. 

5. 

Driveways are to have the smallest configuration possible (particularly within the road verge) to serve 

the required parking facilities and vehicle turning movements and shall comply with AS2890. 

6. 

The location of driveways is to be determined with regard to dwelling design and orientation, street 

gully pits and trees and is to maximise the availability of on-street parking. 

Notes:  Section  3.3  requires  plans  of  subdivision  to  nominate  driveway  locations  and  preferred  building 
envelopes.  The design of dwellings should refer to the approved subdivision plans and be consistent with the 
nominated driveway locations to the greatest practical extent. 

Controls for driveways and access to corner lots are contained in Section 3.2.2 and Figure 3-8.  

7. 

8. 

Driveways are not to be within 1m of any drainage facilities on the kerb and gutter.

  Visual and acoustic privacy 

Objectives 

a. 

To  site  and  design  dwellings  to  meet  user  requirements  for  visual  and  acoustic  privacy,  while 

minimising the visual and acoustic impacts of development on adjoining properties, and 

b. 

To  minimise  the  impact  of  noise  of  other  non-residential  uses  such  as  parking  and  sport  areas, 

restaurants and cafes and waste collection and goods deliveries. 

Controls 

1. 

Direct overlooking of main habitable areas and the private open spaces of adjoining dwellings should 

be  minimised  through  building  layout,  window  and  balcony  location  and  design,  and  the  use  of 

screening, including landscaping. 

2. 

Living area windows with a direct sightline to principal private open space or to habitable room windows 

in an adjacent dwelling within 5 metres are to:  

  be obscured by fencing, screens or landscaping, or 

  be offset from the edge of one  window to the  edge of the other by a  distance sufficient to limit 

views into the adjacent window; or 

  have sill height of 1.7 metres above floor level; or 

  have fixed obscure glazing in any part of the window below 1.7 metres above floor level. 

3. 

Balconies are not permitted on the first floor of the side and / or rear portion of the dwelling except 

where the balcony faces a public road, or land zoned for public recreation or drainage.  

4. 

The  design  of  dwellings  must  minimize  the  opportunity  for  sound  transmission  through  the  building 

structure, with particular attention given to protecting bedrooms and living areas. 

5. 

In attached and semi-detached dwellings, bedrooms of one dwelling are not to share walls with living 

spaces or garages of adjoining dwellings, unless it is demonstrated that the shared walls and floors 

meet the noise transmission and insulation requirements of the Building Code of Australia. 

6. 

No  electrical,  mechanical  or  hydraulic  equipment  or  plant  shall  generate  a  noise  level  greater  than 

5dBA above background noise level measured at the property boundary during the hours 7.00am to 

10.00pm and noise is not to exceed background levels during the hours 10.00pm to 7.00am.  

7. 

Dwellings along sub-arterial or arterial roads or any other noise source, should be designed to minimize 

the impact of traffic noise, and where possible comply with the criteria in Table 4-7. 

Note: Figure 4-11 provides guidance on measures to mitigate noise in residential buildings.

For residential development adjoining sub-arterial and collector roads, where external traffic noise level 

limits  will  be  exceeded  at  the  façade  of  the  residential  premises  nearest  to  the  noise  source,  the 

development will be deemed to comply if:  

 

 

the principal private open space area of the residential premises complies with the relevant noise 

limit; and  

the internal noise levels identified in Table 4-7. 

11. 

Architectural  treatments  are  to  be  designed  in  accordance  with  AS3671  -  Traffic  Noise  Intrusion 

Building Siting and Construction, the indoor sound criteria of AS2107 - Recommended Design Sound 

Levels and Reverberation Times for Building Interiors.

 Fencing 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To ensure boundary fencing is of a high quality and does not detract from the streetscape, 

To encourage the active use of front gardens through provision of a secure area, 

To ensure that rear and side fencing will assist in providing privacy to private open space areas, and 

To  ensure  that  fence  height,  location  and  design  will  not  affect  traffic  and  pedestrian  visibility  at 

intersections. 

Controls 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Front fencing shall be a maximum of 1m high.  

Front fences and walls are not to impede safe sight lines for traffic. 

Side and rear fences are to be a maximum of 1.8m high.  

Side fences not on a street frontage are to be a maximum of 1m high to a point 2m behind the primary 

building façade.  

5. 

On corner lots or lots that have a side boundary that adjoins open space or drainage, the front fencing 

style and height is to be continued along the secondary street or open space/drainage land frontage 

to at least 4m behind the building line of the dwelling.  Principles for corner lots are illustrated at Figure 

4-12.  

6. 

On boundaries that adjoin open space or drainage land, fencing is to be of a high quality material and 

finish. The design of the fencing is to permit casual surveillance of the public space by limiting fence 

height to 1m or by incorporating see through materials or gaps for the portion of the fence above 1m 

high. 

7. 

Pre-painted steel or timber paling or lapped/capped boundary fencing is not permitted adjacent to open 

8. 

9. 

space or drainage land or on front boundaries. 

Fencing that adjoins mews or rear access ways is to permit casual surveillance.  

Where there is a retaining wall on a front boundary of a lot the front fence should be setback 1m from 

the top of the retaining wall. 

10. 

Consideration is to be given to potential loss of privacy and/or overshadowing to adjoining properties 

where side and/or rear boundary fences are to be located on top of retaining walls on the respective 

boundary.

4.3  Additional controls for certain dwelling types 

  Residential development adjacent to transmission easements 

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

To minimise the visual and amenity impacts of transmission lines on surrounding residential areas, 

To provide for passive surveillance of land within and adjacent to transmission easements, and 

To maintain the privacy of dwellings adjacent to the easements. 

Controls  

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

Dwellings are to be set back as far as possible from the transmission easement. 

Fencing that complies with the controls for front fences in Section 4.2.10 is to be used on the property 

boundary facing the easement. 

Side and rear fencing within easements is to allow for maintenance access to and along the easement. 

Landscaping is to permit views into the easement at ground level. 

The orientation of dwellings is to permit casual surveillance of the easement, while maintaining the 

privacy of occupants. 

Balconies on upper floors facing the transmission easement are encouraged. 

The principal private open space for the dwelling is to be screened from view from the transmission 

easement, preferably by being located behind the building line. 

########Page132 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
  Attached or abutting dwellings 

Additional controls for attached dwellings are outlined below, and should be read in conjunction with those in 

Section 4.2. 

Objectives 

a. 

To  ensure  that  the  development  of  attached  or  abutting  dwellings  creates  an  architecturally  consistent 

street character. 

Controls 

1. 

It is preferred that garages for attached dwellings are located at the rear of the lot.  Where attached 

dwellings have frontage to a collector road, all vehicle access and parking is to be located at the rear 

of the lot. 

2. 

Attached  or  abutting  dwellings  should  have  a  pleasing  rhythm  and  order  when  seen  together  as  a 

group, rather than appear as a random arrangement of competing dwellings.  Each dwelling should 

benefit  from  the  unified  design  of  the  whole  form,  a  co-ordinated  style  and  base  colour  palette.  

Individuality can be added as small details or accent colours, rather than strikingly different forms. 

  Secondary dwellings, studio dwellings and dual occupancies  

Controls for secondary dwellings, studio dwellings or dual occupancies are in part determined by whether the 

secondary, principal or dual occupancy dwelling is proposed at the time of the application or at some point in 

the  future  to  be  strata  subdivided.    Strata  subdivisions  create  the  need  for  separate  or  common  property 

dwelling entries, parking and open space to service each dwelling. 

The Glossary of this DCP provides further explanation and examples of secondary dwelling, studio dwellings 

or dual occupancy types.  The controls that follow apply to all forms of secondary dwellings, studio dwellings 

and dual occupancies.  

Objectives 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

To enable the development of a diversity of dwelling types. 

To contribute to the availability of affordable housing. 

To promote innovative housing solutions that are compatible with the surrounding residential environment. 

To provide casual surveillance to rear lanes. 

Controls - Secondary dwellings and studio dwellings 

1. 

Secondary dwellings and studio dwellings are to comply with the controls in Section 4.2, except where 

the controls in this clause differ, in which case the controls in this clause take precedence. 

2. 

Secondary dwellings and studio dwellings are to comply with the key controls in Table 4-8. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page133 

 
3. 

The maximum site coverage control for upper floors  in  the relevant Table 4-2 toTable 4-6 may be 

exceeded  by  the  combined  upper  floor  coverage  of  the  secondary  or  studio  dwelling  and  principal 

dwelling, providing that: 

  The privacy of the principal dwelling and dwellings on adjoining land is not compromised; and 

  Solar access to the principal private open space of neighbouring lots is not significantly reduced. 

The maximum gross floor area of a studio dwelling is 75m2. 

The finishes, materials and colours of the secondary dwelling or studio dwelling are to complement the 

principal dwelling in its construction features. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

For secondary dwellings, windows and private open spaces must not overlook the private open space 

of any adjacent dwellings.  For studio dwellings, windows and private open spaces must not overlook 

the  private  open  space  of  any  adjacent  dwellings  including  the  principal  dwelling.        Windows  that 

potentially overlook adjacent lots must either have obscured glazing, be screened or have a minimum 

sill height of 1.5m above floor level. 

7. 

Secondary  or  studio  dwellings  and  associated  garages  may  have  a  zero  lot  setback  to  one  side 

boundary and may be attached to another garage/secondary dwelling on an adjoining lot, particularly 

where the secondary or studio dwelling is associated with an attached or semi-detached dwelling.

8. 

Where the secondary or studio dwelling is built to a zero lot line on a side boundary, windows are not 

to be located on the zero lot wall unless that wall adjoins a laneway, public road, public open space or 

drainage land. 

9. 

Studio dwellings are to have balconies or living areas that overlook laneways for casual surveillance. 

10. 

Rear garages with secondary or studio dwellings may have first level balconies facing the lane provided 

the balcony remains within the lot boundary.  Where 2m deep, overhanging balconies for private open 

space requirements of studio  dwellings are  located along a  lane, the  application must demonstrate 

how  garages  setback  underneath  avoid  creating  an  overly  wide  lane  and  ambiguous  space 

opportunities for illegally parked cars, trailers, bins etc. 

11. 

Where a secondary or studio dwelling is built over a rear garage and separated from the upper levels 

of  the  principal  dwelling,  there  must  be  a  minimum  separation  of  5m  between  the  upper  floor  rear 

façade of the principal dwelling and the secondary or studio dwelling. 

12. 

Studio dwellings are to be located at the rear of the lot only where the lot has access from a rear lane 

or secondary street on a corner lot. 

13. 

Studio  dwellings  must  comply  with  separation  controls  nominated  in  Australian  Standards  and  the 

National Construction Code. 

14. 

Studio dwellings are not permitted where the principal dwelling is an attached dwelling, unless: 

  The studio dwelling is located above a rear loaded garage; and 

  The studio dwelling has direct access to a public road or laneway; and 

  Garbage and mail facilities are accessible by residents and by service vehicles. 

Controls – Dual occupancies 

1. 

Dual  occupancies  are  to  comply  with  the  controls  in  Section  4.2,  except  where  the  controls  in  this 

clause differ, in which case the controls in this clause take precedence. 

2. 

The maximum site coverage control for second storeys in the relevant Table 4-2 toTable 4-6 may be 

exceeded by the combined 2nd storey coverage of both dwellings in a dual occupancy, providing that: 

  The privacy of the principal dwelling and dwellings on adjoining land is not compromised; and 

  Solar  access  requirements  for  the  principal  private  open  space  can  be  met  for  the  principal 

dwelling and dwellings on adjoining lots. 

3. 

The  design  of  both  dwellings  in  a  dual  occupancy  development  is  to  be  consistent  in  construction 

features, finishes, materials and colours. 

4. 

Detached dual occupancy dwellings are not to include zero lot lines for the second dwelling where the 

second dwelling is located at the rear of the lot. 

5. 

Dual occupancy development is not permitted on a lot that contains an attached dwelling.  

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page135 

 
6. 

Dual occupancy dwellings are permitted at the rear of lots (i.e. behind a dwelling that has frontage to 

a principal street, whether attached or detached to that dwelling) only where: 

  Each dwelling has direct pedestrian and vehicle access to a public road; and 

  Garbage  and  mail  facilities  are  accessible  by  service  vehicles  and  by  the  occupants  of  the 

dwellings. 

7. 

8. 

Dual occupancy development referred to in control 6 above is preferred to be located on corner lots. 

For  dual  occupancies  on  corner  lots,  the  rear  setback can  be  varied  to  be  consistent  with  the  side 

setbacks in Section 4.2.4, provided the minimum private open space and solar access requirements 

to the proposed and adjoining properties are met. 

9. 

Where the dual occupancy dwellings are to be strata subdivided:  

  private open space is to be provided for each dwelling in accordance with the relevant controls in 

Table 4-2 toTable 4-6, or  

 

shared  private open space is to be provided  equivalent to 15% of the site  area  and shown as 

communal space on the strata plan, and a minimum area of private open space of 10m² with a 

minimum dimension of 2.5m is to be provided for each dwelling. 

10. 

The minimum landscaped area on a lot containing a dual occupancy development is to be 20% of the 

site area. 

11.  Where practical for front loaded driveway access, shared driveway crossings of the nature strip are to 

be provided to service both dwellings.

To ensure the provision of housing that will, in its adaptable features, meet the access and mobility needs of any 

occupant. 

Controls 

1. 

2. 

In density areas of 20dw/Ha and 25dw/Ha, manor homes may only be located on corner lots. 

Residential flat buildings are to: 

  be located on sites with a minimum street frontage of 30m,and 

  have direct frontage to an area of the public domain (including streets and public parks), and 

  not  adversely  impact  upon  the  existing  or  future  amenity  of  any  adjoining  land  upon  which 
residential  development  is  permitted  with  respect  to  overshadowing  impact,  privacy  impact  or 
visual impact. 

3. 

All residential flat buildings are to be consistent with: 

 

 

the guidelines and principles outlined in SEPP No. 65 – Residential Flat Development; and  

the primary controls set out in Table 4-10, which take precedence over the above where there is 
any inconsistency.  

4. 

In all residential flat building developments containing 10 dwellings or more, a minimum of 10% of all apartments 

are to be designed to be capable of adaptation for access by people with all levels of mobility. Dwellings must be

4.4  Other development in residential areas 

The residential zones within the Precinct Plan permit a range of non-residential land uses which, depending 

on their scale, suitability, location and design, may be compatible with adjoining residential uses.  Reference 

should be made to the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington) for the permissibility of 

specific non-residential uses in each zone, including the zoning table in Part 3 and the local provisions in Part 

6.  For some land uses, the local  provisions in  Part  6 specify additional requirements that must be met for 

Council to grant consent to these uses. 

The Precinct Plan recognises that allowing non-residential development in the residential zones is appropriate 

providing controls are in place to minimise the negative impacts of noise, loss of privacy, traffic, and parking 

on residential amenity. 

The controls for non-residential development consist of: 

 

 

General requirements, which apply to all non-residential development in residential zones. 

Specific provisions covering land uses such as child care centres, neighbourhood shops, educational 

establishments and places of public worship, in addition to, or overriding, the general requirements. 

Notes:  

In the event of an inconsistency between the general and specific provisions in this section of the DCP, the 
specific controls will prevail. 

These controls are not intended to apply to home occupations. 

Council  may  require  the  submission  of  additional  information  to  demonstrate  that  the  development  will  not 
adversely affect the existing or future amenity of the surrounding residential area. Such information may include 
a  noise  impact  assessment,  advice  on  traffic  generating  potential  and  parking  provision,  solar  access  and 
evidence that the proposed land use will contribute to the amenity, character and liveability of the residential 
area  in which  it  is to  be  located.   Applicants should  consult with Council prior to submitting  a development 
application to determine specific information requirements.

  General requirements 

Objectives 

a. 

To establish appropriate controls to minimise the adverse effects of non-residential development on 

surrounding residential development, 

b. 

To maintain consistency in development standards between non-residential and residential land uses 

and ensure that buildings are similar in height, bulk and scale to surrounding buildings, 

c. 

d. 

To ensure that non-residential development is appropriately located, and 

To avoid concentrations of non-residential uses in any particular area where the cumulative impact on 

residential amenity would be unacceptable. 

Controls  

1. 

Site analysis information as required by Section 4.1.1 is to be submitted with all applications for non-

residential development in residential zones. 

2. 

Except as provided for in the specific controls below, non-residential development on residential zoned 

land is to be located on allotments that have a frontage width of greater than 15 metres. 

Note:  The  relevant  Precinct  Plan  specifies  minimum  site  area  development  standards  for  some  non-  

residential land uses within residential zones. 

3. 

Non-residential development on residential zoned land is to comply with the requirements of Sections 

4.1.2  to  4.1.4  and  Sections  4.2.9  and  4.2.10  of  this  DCP  in  relation  to  residential  amenity  and 

sustainable building design. 

4. 

For all non-residential development, the controls relating to lots with frontages greater than 15 metres 

in the following sections of this DCP apply: 

  Section 4.2.3 Front setbacks; 

  Section 4.2.4 Side and rear setbacks; 

  Section 4.2.5 Dwelling height, massing and siting; and 

  Section 4.2.8 Garages, site access and parking. 

Non-residential development is not permitted on battleaxe allotments. 

The maximum site coverage of buildings is 60% of the total site area. 

The minimum  landscaped  area  for  non-residential  development  is  20%  of  the  total  site  area  of  the 

allotment. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8. 

Provision of car parking for non-residential uses will be assessed by Council on an individual basis, 

and  with  reference  to  local  policies  that  may  establish  relevant  parking  requirements,  but  must  be 

sufficient to meet demand generated by staff and visitors.   

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page143 

 
9. 

Where  a  non-residential  use  is  proposed  as  part  of,  or  in  association  with,  a  dwelling  (eg.  a  home 

business):  

  Parking and storage areas are to be located behind the building façade or be screened from view 

from the street by landscaping, and 

  Parking and storage areas are not to encroach on the private open space or landscaped area of 

the dwelling. 

10. 

Where  there  is  an  inconsistency  between  the  general  requirements  of  this  section  and  the  specific 

controls in Sections 4.4.3 to 4.4.6, the specific controls prevail. 

11. 

Council  will  have  particular  regard  to  the  effects  of  non-residential  development  in  the  residential 

zones. Council will consider whether: 

 

 

the  proposed  development  will  be  out  of  character  with  surrounding  residential  development, 

particularly in relation to the height and/or scale of any proposed buildings; 

the proposed development will contribute to an undesirable clustering of that type of development, 

or non-residential uses in general, in the area; 

  an undesirable effect on the amenity of the surrounding area will be created; 

 

the proposed use will draw patronage from areas outside of the surrounding neighbourhood, and 

the extent to which that patronage might impact on the amenity of residents through factors such 

as traffic generation, noise or the overall scale of the non-residential use; 

  a noise nuisance will be created; 

 

the development will generate traffic out of keeping with the locality; 

  adequate facilities are provided for the purposes of parking, loading and deliveries; 

  adequate provision is made for access by disabled persons. 

12. 

Non-residential development in residential zones should be similar in bulk, scale, height and siting to 

the surrounding buildings.  

13. 

Finishes, materials, paving and landscaping are to be consistent with those of surrounding residential 

development. 

14. 

Storage of materials and equipment is to be contained within internal storage areas or outdoor storage 

areas that are suitably screened, fenced and landscaped.

1. 

A child care centre located on an allotment of land that is accessed from or has a boundary to Camden 

Valley Way or Denham Court Road will not be supported. 

2. 

Applicants proposing child care centres should refer to Council’s DCP (Part 7 (Child Care Centres) of 

the Campbelltown (Sustainable City) Development Control Plan 2009) for controls that are applicable 

to the development.  

  Educational Establishments and Places of Worship  

Objectives 

a. 

To ensure appropriate provision and equitable distribution of educational establishments and places 

of public worship within the Precinct, 

b. 

To ensure that buildings are not out of character with the type, height, bulk and scale of surrounding

To  encourage  the  appropriate  location  of  facilities  to  create  community  focal  points,  centres  of 

neighbourhood activity and enhance community identity,  

d. 

To mitigate the impacts of noise, privacy,  increased traffic and nuisance  on surrounding residential 

development, and 

e. 

To foster iconic and landmark building design within each Precinct. 

Controls 

1. 

Places  of  worship  are  to  be  located  within  centres  or  co-located  with  other  community  facilities  in 

residential areas  so as to create a community focal  point, to share facilities such as parking where 

possible, and to minimise impacts on residential areas. 

2. 

Places  of  public  worship  and  educational  establishments  are  preferably  to  be  located  on  land  with 

frontage to a collector road.  Corner sites are preferred. 

3.

  hours of operation and noise impacts. 

4. 

A traffic and transport report/statement is to accompany the development application addressing the 

impact of the proposed development on the local road system and defining car parking requirements. 

Note: Due to the high level of traffic generation and peak nature of traffic volumes accessing these types of 
land uses, assessment of traffic impacts and pedestrian requirements is required and mitigation measures may 
need  to  be  incorporated  in  the  design.  Such  measures  may  include  pedestrian  crossings,  speed  control 
devices, pedestrian refuges on streets to which the development fronts and the provision of bus and drop off 
bays. School zones will require additional safety measures such as school crossings, 40  km/h school speed 
zones and flashing lights in accordance with RMS requirements. 

5. 

A landscape plan and associated documentation is to be submitted with the development application 

identifying existing vegetation and community plant species and/or existing design elements of the site 

layout, and the proposed landscaping treatment of the development. 

6. 

Car parking spaces shall be provided on site in accordance with Table 4-11, unless the applicant can 

demonstrate to the satisfaction of Council that lower rates of parking are reasonable for the particular 

development.

5.2  Development principles 

The following development principles apply to all centres to which this part of the DCP applies.  The 

principles  should  be  considered  by  applicants  for  all  applications  for  development  in  centres.    The 

controls in Section 5.3 are based on these principles, and where an application does not comply with 

the controls, Council will consider whether the proposed development is consistent with the relevant 

development principles when determining the application. 

  General 

1. 

2. 

The location of centres shall be in accordance with Figure 5-1. 

The local centre is to be located within Campbelltown LGA and is to contain a mix of retail, 

commercial and community land uses. 

3. 

A maximum gross floor area of 16,500m2 applies to retail premises within the B2 Local Centre 

zone. 

4. 

All local and neighbourhood centres are to contain a mix of large floorplate and specialty retail 

uses. 

5. 

Neighbourhood shops, located outside the defined centres, are encouraged where they serve 

a particular market need and can be integrated with surrounding land uses.  Out of centre 

retailing is not encouraged where it is inconsistent with the ILP or where it would jeopardise 

the function and viability of the local and neighbourhood centre. 

  Function and land use mix 

a. 

A range of retail, commercial, entertainment, recreation and community uses is encouraged to 

serve the needs of the wider community and promote active and vibrant centres. 

b. 

Mixed use developments containing residential uses on upper floors are located in the centre 

to take advantage of access to transport and services, and to increase levels of activity within 

the centre. 

Employment opportunities are maximised within the centre. 

The ground floor of all buildings is occupied by retail, commercial, community, entertainment or 

other active uses, particularly fronting the main street and all open space. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

Fine grained and intensive retail and commercial uses that present an active street frontage 

are located along the main street. 

########Page156 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
f. 

Building design integrates internal spaces (i.e. the interior of shops and other businesses) and 

the public domain (i.e. the streets, plazas and parks), and facilitates active use of footpaths by 

cafes and the like. 

g. 

The needs of health and aged care providers, facilities for young people, civic and emergency 

services are met within the centres. 

  Design layout 

a. 

Any main street acts as the focal point for the retail and commercial activity in the centre and is 

of a width and design that encourages pedestrian activity and a low speed traffic environment.  

b. 

Large  format  retail  premises  (such  as  supermarkets  and  discount  department  stores)  have 

pedestrian access to any main street, and do not present blank walls or inactive facades to any 

main street. 

c. 

The importance of car parking to the viability of retailing is recognised, but does not dictate the 

location and orientation of retail premises at the expense of an active public domain. 

d. 

The core retail areas and fringes are clearly defined by the mix of land uses and intensity of 

development that integrates with surrounding residential areas. 

e. 

Facilities  including  loading,  waste  storage,  servicing  and  other  infrastructure  are  to  be  co-

located  as  much  as  possible  to  maximise  the  efficient  use  of  space  while  ensuring  these 

facilities do not adversely impact on the amenity of surrounding sensitive land uses. 

f. 

An  interconnected  street  block  network  with  small  block  sizes  and  mid-block  connections 

maximises pedestrian movement and connections to key destinations including parks, plazas 

and transport nodes. 

g. 

Noise and amenity considerations inform the layout and location of various uses, particularly 

residential uses. 

h. 

The street network emphasises sight lines to local landscape features, places of key cultural 

significance, civic buildings and public open space. 

i. 

Opportunities  for  crime  are  minimised  through  appropriate  design  and  maintenance,  in 

accordance with the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design in Section 

2.6 of this DCP. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page157 

 
  Public domain 

a. 

The streetscape creates a high amenity pedestrian environment through solar access, shade 

and shelter, good natural light, landscaping and footpath design, and management of vehicular 

traffic.  

b. 

Parks and plazas are a focal point for  people,  businesses and community activities and  are 

designed to ensure adaptability and flexibility in use and function over time. 

c. 

High  standards  of  design  and  landscaping,  based  on  consistent  public  domain  design 

standards,  promote  the  character  and  attractiveness  of  the  centre  and  create  a  sense  of 

ownership and pride for businesses and residents. 

d. 

Activities  that  activate  the  streets,  the  park  and  plaza  draw  people  to  the  centre  not  only  to 

shop, but for entertainment and recreation, such as markets, concerts and outdoor community 

events. 

  Built form 

a. 

A  range  of  building  heights  are  permitted,  up  to  maximum  heights  to  control  amenity  and 

overshadowing, to create a varied skyline. 

b. 

Building  heights  transition  around  the  fringes  of  the  centre  to  integrate  the  built  form  with 

adjacent residential areas.  

c. 

Building  heights  and  setbacks  are  related  to  street  widths  and  functions  to  promote  a 

comfortable urban scale of development. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

Building separation and orientation considers privacy and amenity, particularly for residents. 

Building heights take into account view lines and solar access to the public domain. 

Streets and open spaces are defined by buildings that are generally built to the street edge, 

have a consistent street wall height and provide a continuous street frontage, particularly along 

the main street and fronting the town square. 

g. 

A high quality built form and energy efficient architectural design promotes a ‘sense of place’ 

and contemporary character for the centre. 

  Transport 

a. 

The local centre is pedestrian and public transport orientated with walking and cycling taking 

priority over vehicles, while allowing for vehicle movement and access in a low speed traffic 

environment.  

########Page158 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
b. 

Any  main  street  carries  sufficient  traffic  volumes,  and  has  provision  for  on-street  parking,  to 

support retail and commercial uses that front it. 

c. 

Streets  are  wide  enough  to  ensure  pedestrians,  cyclists  and  vehicles  can  move  around  the 

centre,  to  encourage  activity  on  the  street  and  to  enable  a  clear  relationship  between 

development on either side of the road. 

d. 

Traffic  signals  and  pedestrian  crossings  facilitate  easy movement  of  pedestrians  throughout 

the centre. 

e. 

The street layout allows easy access to and within the centre while allowing for regional traffic 

to by-pass the centre. 

f. 

Vehicle access to parking and loading areas is via secondary streets rather than the main street 

or other active streets. 

5.3  Development controls 

Streetscape and architectural design 

Objectives 

a. 

To  achieve  high  standards  of  streetscape  amenity  and  building  design,  and  a  consistent 

streetscape, 

b. 

c. 

To encourage pedestrian activity in the streets of the local centre and other public spaces, and 

To clearly define the character of any main street and other elements of the public domain. 

Controls - active frontage and street address 

1. 

Active street fronts, built to the street boundary, are required on the ground level of all retail and 

commercial development fronting any main street and where applicable, public open space. 

2. 

The initial development application for development in the local centre is to include a master 

plan showing: 

  The location of the proposed development site in the context of the overall local centre, and 

relative to key features of the centre including the main street and other public spaces such 

as parks, squares and plazas. 

  Active street frontages and safe pedestrian movements to and within the centre. 

  Proposed vehicle and pedestrian access routes within and to the centre and how the centre 

will connect with the bus network to encourage use of buses, walking and cycling. 

  Public domain landscape and urban design plan for the centre which establishes:

i.  Preferred materials, colours and finishes for paving  and footpaths and other 

public spaces, 

ii.  Preferred street tree species, 

iii.  Specifications  for  street  furniture  including  seating,  lighting,  signage,  bike 

facilities, and 

iv.  Public art. 

3. 

Residential,  commercial  and  retail  uses  on  the  upper  floors  are  to  be  designed  to  overlook 

streets and other public places to provide passive surveillance. 

4. 

The ground and first floor of all buildings on active street frontages are to be built to the front 

property boundary (ie. a zero front setback) to define the street edge.  If the first floor contains 

residential  uses,  internal  spaces  may  be  set  back  where  balconies  are  built  to  the  property 

boundary. 

5. 

The primary means of pedestrian access to retail, commercial and upper floor residential uses 

is to be from the street rather than from the rear or internal areas of the building. Building entries 

should be prominent, clearly identifiable and accessible. 

6. 

Vehicle access to basement level parking or parking located behind buildings must not be from 

active street frontages. 

7. 

All  large  format  retail  premises  and  decked  parking  areas  are  to  be  sleeved  with  uses  that 

provide an active frontage to the street. 

Blank walls visible from the public domain are to be avoided. 

Retail shops are to have a variety of shop frontage widths and articulation.  

8. 

9. 

10. 

Restaurants, cafes and the like are encouraged to provide openable shop fronts and to make 

use of footpath areas on active streets. 

11. 

On  corner  sites,  active  shop  fronts  are  to  wrap  around  the  corner  and  address  both  street 

frontages. 

12. 

Developments that have multiple street frontages are to consider entrances to internal/upper 

floor uses on each street frontage. 

13. 

In mixed-use buildings, separate access from the street is required for retail, commercial and 

residential uses. 

14. 

Entrances are to be visible from the street and well lit. 

15. 

Security shutters and grilles are not encouraged and any proposed security devices are to be 

transparent or at least 80% open. 

16. 

All buildings on active street frontages are to include awnings above the ground floor for the full 

length of the street frontage. 

########Page160 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
17. 

Parking  is  to  be  screened  by  buildings,  from  the  main  street  and  other  streets  with  active 

frontages, or be below ground. 

Controls – building facades and awnings 

18. 

Building facades at street level on active frontage streets are to have a minimum of 80% glazing. 

19. 

Translucent or obscured glazing is generally not permitted on active street frontages. 

20. 

Signage and advertising material are not to obscure glazing where possible. 

21. 

At night, internal lighting is to fall onto the footpath, or under-awning lighting is to be provided. 

22. 

Solid elements are preferably to be finished with rendered masonry, tiles or face brick. 

23. 

Coordinated colour schemes are required, and colours and materials are to be consistent with 

adjoining buildings and the general character of the street. 

24. 

Façade  articulation  is  encouraged  above  the  ground  floor  through  the  incorporation  of 

balconies, openings and other design elements that modulate the façade, providing rhythm and 

interest. 

25. 

Articulated corners are to be provided to building facades on active street frontages.  Articulated 

elements  may  include  verandahs,  awnings,  upper  level  balconies,  use  of  materials  or  roof 

designs that accentuate the corner.  Articulation elements are to address street frontages. 

26. 

Design of corner buildings on the ground floor is to facilitate free pedestrian movement.  Open 

corners at ground level are encouraged. 

27. 

Building height, massing, materials and parapet/roof expression should be used to accentuate 

corner elements.  Council may consider proposals on street corners that do not meet relevant 

height controls where the design of the building accentuates the corner, creates a landmark 

and is well designed. 

28. 

Awnings  should  be  a  minimum  height  of  2.7m  (3.2m  desirable)  above  footpath  level  and 

generally consistent in form with adjacent awnings. 

29. 

The front fascia of the awning is to be set back a minimum of 500mm from the kerb of the street 

carriageway, including at street corners.  

30. 

Awnings are generally to project horizontally from the building façade and be horizontal along 

the length of the façade.  Stepped awnings are appropriate on sloping streets.   

31. 

The design of awnings is to be generally consistent with adjoining buildings.   

Note: Any awning over a public footpath will require a Public Road Activity Approval to be issued by the 

Consent Authority.

9am-3pm on June 21st on a minimum of 50% of the southern footpaths. 

4. 

Continuous awnings are required to be provided along the ground floor street frontage on active 

street frontages in accordance with Figure 5-2 and all buildings fronting public open space or 

squares. 

5. 

The design of awnings is to comply with the controls in Section 5.3.1, and: 

  Ensure that the solar access controls in controls 1, 2 and 3 above are achieved. 

  Ensure  that  protection  from  rain  and  summer  sun  is  provided  to  a  minimum  of  75%  of 

footpath areas. 

6. 

The design and orientation of buildings is to consider prevailing south-westerly winds in winter, 

and active frontages are to be located to maximise shielding from strong winds by buildings. 

7. 

Uses that are likely to occupy footpaths should be generally located on the southern or western 

sides of active streets to take advantage of winter sun and protection from winter winds. 

8. 

Loading, parking and service areas are  preferably to  be located on the southern or  western 

sides of buildings, except where the western or southern side of a development site adjoins an 

active street. 

9. 

Residential development within the local centre is to be generally oriented with living areas and 

balconies facing north. 

10. 

Residential development within the local centre is to be designed to maximise natural cross-

ventilation.

heritage site, as indicated on the Aboriginal cultural heritage sites Figure (refer to Figure 6-12) 

must consider and comply with the requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.  

9.  Where the necessary consents under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 have been 

obtained, the development application must demonstrate that the development will be undertaken 

in accordance with the requirements of that consent. 

Notes:  

Any works, development or other activity that will impact on a known site of Aboriginal cultural heritage 
significance may require approval under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1974, in addition to any 
approval  requirements  of  Council  under  the  Campbelltown  Growth  Centres  Precinct  Plan  (East 
Leppington).  Applicants should consult with the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) to determine 
requirements for assessment and approval where developments or other works are to be carried out 
on or near Aboriginal heritage sites identified on the Aboriginal cultural heritage sites figure (Figure 
6-12). 

Council or the OEH may require additional investigations to be undertaken as part of a development 
application to confirm the presence of Aboriginal cultural heritage on the land. 

Where works uncover items that may be Aboriginal cultural heritage, the applicant is to consult with the 
OEH to determine an appropriate course of action.

Upper Canal, and 

d. 

To protect water quality by preventing stormwater or other pollutants entering the Upper 

Canal system. 

Controls 

1. 

Where major development (including subdivision) is proposed adjacent to the Upper Canal 

corridor, applicants shall consult with the Sydney Catchment Authority (SCA) as part of the 

process of preparing the development application.  Development is to be consistent with the 

SCA publication “Guidelines for development adjacent to the Upper Canal and Warragamba 

Pipelines".  Any written requirements of the SCA shall be submitted with the DA and the DA 

documentation shall show how the requirements have been addressed.   

2. 

Prior written approval shall be obtained from the SCA for any access that may be required to 

the Upper Canal corridor during the investigation and construction phases. .  

3. 

Access points to the Upper Canal for SCA staff and contractors to carry out inspections and 

maintenance shall be retained or provided in accordance with SCA requirements.  

4. 

Site preparation and construction works carried out adjacent to or crossing the Upper Canal 

shall avoid impacting on water quality and damaging the Canal infrastructure, in accordance 

with SCA requirements.  

5. 

Stormwater systems serving development adjacent to the Upper Canal shall be designed to 

ensure that stormwater does not enter the Canal. Stormwater management measures shall 

accommodate and not impede upstream flows from any systems that convey stormwater 

across, along or under the Upper Canal.  Detailed plans showing the proposed stormwater 

management and runoff from development are to be submitted with the development 

application.  The plans must demonstrate that stormwater will be managed up to the 1 in 100 

year flood event to prevent runoff from within the Precinct entering the Canal. 

6. 

Shareways may be located to the front or side boundary of a lot. Where shareways are to the 

side boundary, fences are to be maximum 1.8m high to the rear yard only. Side fences are to 

be 1.2m to corners. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page203 

 
7. 

Appropriate security fencing shall be provided, or existing fencing retained along the length of 

development boundaries that directly adjoin the Upper Canal corridor, in accordance with 

SCA requirements.  

8. 

Road, pedestrian and cycleway crossings of the Upper Canal shall be minimized and located 

and designed in accordance with SCA requirements.  

9. 

A local road, shareway or pedestrian/ cycle way is to be provided, between development and 

the Upper Canal corridor (refer to Figure 6-18). Wherever possible a road is to contain a 

landscaped verge between the carriageway and Upper Canal corridor.  A footpath is not 

required to be constructed on the Canal side road verge as part of subdivision of adjoining 

land. 

10. 

The State Heritage status of the Upper Canal should be taken into account when designing 

development adjacent to the Canal corridor.  

Note: The Upper Canal is owned and managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority and is located on 
land classified as a controlled area under the Sydney Water Catchment Management Act 1998. The 
Canal begins at Pheasants Nest Weir on the Nepean River and transfers water from the Upper Nepean 
dams to the Prospect Water Filtration Plant to supply a significant part of Sydney’s drinking water. The 
Upper Canal is historically significant having functioned as part of Sydney’s main water supply system 
for more than 120 years and is listed on the State Heritage Register.

Note:  definitions  for  terms  are  also  included  in  the  Dictionary  contained  within  the  Growth  Centres 

SEPP,  and  in  the  event  of  any  inconsistency,  the  definition  in  the  Growth  Centres  SEPP  takes 

precedence over the definitions in this DCP. 

“Abutting Dwelling” is a building containing one dwelling, on a single block of land that is designed 

and constructed on a zero lot line immediately adjacent to another dwelling on a different lot that is also 

built to the zero lot line and is structurally independent of any other dwelling.  See Figure 1.   

Figure 1: Detached, zero lot line, abutting and attached dwellings 

“Access Streets and Laneways” provide local residential access to a small number of dwellings and 

serve a shared vehicular-pedestrian-cyclist use. They are intended to encourage a safe, low vehicle 

speed environment in which the residential function is dominant. Access streets function at the lowest 

level  of  the  road  hierarchy.  They  generally  have  development  on  one  side  and  are  located  along 

drainage or open space reserves or  along  access-denied roads. The construction and  dedication of 

access streets is the responsibility of the developer. 

“Articulation zone” includes verandahs, porches, awnings, shading devices, bay windows, pergolas 

and the like. A carport is not considered part of the articulation zone. 

“Active Frontages” are defined as one or a combination of the following:

dwellings on separate allotments that are joined by at least one common wall. See Figure 1. 

“Arterial roads” are roads marked as such on  the  Precinct  Road Hierarchy  figure in the relevant 

Precinct Schedule. They are major roads that carry the majority of inter-regional traffic. Vehicular access 

from adjacent land is denied to ensure both the efficiency of the road and the safety of road users. 

“Building footprint” means the area of land measured at finished ground level that is enclosed by the 

external walls of a building. 

“Campbelltown  Growth  Centres  Precinct  Plan  (East  Leppington)”  means  Appendix  10  to  State 

Environmental Planning Policy (Sydney Region Growth Centres) 2006. 

“Collector roads” are roads marked as such on the Precinct Road Hierarchy figure in the relevant 

Precinct  Schedule.  They  are  the  main  internal  roads  that  carry  local  traffic  through  the  residential 

neighbourhoods to the sub-arterial and arterial roads, and provide access to major attractors within the 

precinct such as retail, commercial and educational facilities.

“Detached Dwelling” is a building containing one dwelling, on a single block of land that is not attached 

to any other dwelling. See Figure 2. 

Figure 2:  Detached dwelling 

Dual Occupancy is defined in the Dictionary to the Growth Centres SEPP. A dual occupancy comprises 

two dwellings on a single allotment of land. The dwellings may be attached to each other or separate and 

detached.  

Dual occupancy housing includes:  

 

 

 

 

the alteration or addition to an existing dwelling-house erected on an allotment so as to create two 

dwellings; 

the erection of another detached dwelling-house in addition to one already erected on an allotment, 

but only if not more than two dwellings will be created as a result of the development being carried 

out; 

the erection of a single building containing two dwellings on one allotment. 

the erection of two detached dwellings on one allotment. The dwelling may or may not be strata 

subdivided. See Figure 3.

“Dual  Occupancy  –  Lifehouse  Dwellings” - The  life  house  is  a  housing  initiative  that  is  designed  to 

facilitate the changing lifestyle needs of the home buyer. When built, the Lifehouse can respond to the 

current  need  of  the  resident.  In  time,  as  the  residents’  needs  change,  the  dwelling  can  grow/downsize 

according to their needs, without them having to go through the expense of relocating. See Figure 4. 

Lifehouse dwellings:  

 

 

can only occur on corner lots where eventual dual access will be possible to both dwellings; 

can be built on a single level, on split level or on as two storey dwellings. The development of Stage 

2 must comply with separation controls nominated in Australian Standards and the Building Code 

of Australia (BCA), enabling the final dual occupancy division of Stage 3 to progress without major 

works.  

  must have all stages of the development designed and approved as part of the initial DA regardless 

of the proposed staging of construction and subdivision.

“Flood  Planning  Levels  (FPLs)”  are  the  combinations  of  flood  levels  (derived  from  significant 

historical  flood  events  or  floods  of  specific  AEPs)  and  freeboards  selected  for  floodplain  risk 

management purposes, as determined in management studies and incorporated in management plans. 

Flood planning area is the area of land below the FPL and thus subject to flood related development 

controls. The concept of flood planning area generally supersedes the ‘flood liable land” concept in the 

1986 Manual. Flood Prone Land is land susceptible to flooding by the PMF event. Flood Prone Land is 

synonymous with flood liable land. 

“Habitable room” means any room or area used for normal domestic activities, including living, dining, 

family, lounge, bedrooms, study, kitchen, sun room, home entertainment room, alfresco room and play 

room.

(excluding eaves <450mm to fascia board), outdoor rooms, balconies, rooftop gardens, terraces, decks, 

verandahs and the like. 

“Local  roads”  are  roads  marked  as  such  on  the  Precinct  Road  Hierarchy  figure  in  the  relevant 

Precinct Schedule.  The function of the subdivisional roads, which may include minor loop roads and 

culs-de-sac, is to provide access to residential properties.  

“Manor House” means a 2-storey building containing 4 dwellings, where: 

(a)  each storey contains 2 dwellings, and 
(b)  each dwelling is on its own lot (being a lot within a lot within a strata scheme or community 

title scheme), and 

(c)  access to each dwelling is provided through a common or individual entry at ground level, 

but does not include a residential flat building or multi-dwelling housing. 

“Outdoor room”, also known as an ‘alfresco room’ is a semi enclosed space (at least 1 side open) 

located  adjacent  a  living  /  dining  /  kitchen  area  of  a  dwelling  that  sits  within  the  main  roof  line  of  a 

dwelling.  

“Pervious area” means the parts of the site where water is able to permeate the soil, and excludes 

any areas that are paved, roofed or otherwise covered with impervious materials. 

“Principal dwelling” means the largest dwelling house on a lot, measured by gross floor area. 

“Principal  private  open  space”  means  the  portion  of  private  open  space  which  is  conveniently 

accessible from a living zone of the dwelling, and which receives the required amount of solar access. 

“Private open space” means the portion of private land which serves as an extension of the dwelling 

to provide space for relaxation, dining, entertainment and recreation. It includes an outdoor room. 

“Riparian Corridor” means the riparian protection area as shown on the Riparian Protection Areas 

map under the Growth Centres SEPP. 

“Secondary  Dwellings”  - Secondary  dwellings  are  defined  in  the  Dictionary  to  the  Growth  Centres 

SEPP. They are dwellings that are on the same parcel of land as another dwelling, but are separate to 

the principal dwelling, have a separate access and have a maximum internal floor area as specified in 

the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct Plan (East Leppington).  

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page211 

 
Secondary dwellings must form a part of the DA submission for the main dwelling. A secondary dwelling 

that has its own separate access and parking can be strata subdivided at the time of DA approval or 

after the dwelling has been established. 

Types of secondary dwelling: 

  On grade studio unit (at ground level – See Figures 5 and 6) within the principle dwelling lot. This 

is only permitted within detached dwelling lots; 

  Above garage (See Figures 7 and 8). This is only permitted on lots that have garages with rear 

access.

“Site cover” refers to the percentage of the site area that is occupied by the building footprint, including 

any outdoor room and garages. 

“Studio Dwelling” means a dwelling that: 

(a)  Is established in conjunction with another dwelling (the principal dwelling), and 
(b)  Is on its own lot of land, and 
(c)  Is erected above a garage that is on the same lot of land as the principal dwelling, whether the 

garage is attached to, or separate from, the principle dwelling. Refer to Figures 7 & 10. 

but does not include a demi-detached dwelling. 

Figure 10:  Indicative example of a studio dwelling above a garage 

“Sub-arterial roads” are roads marked as such on the Precinct Road Hierarchy figure in the relevant 

Precinct  Schedule.  Sub-arterial  roads  link  regional  and  local  traffic  routes.  Access  from  private 

properties is generally  denied to  these roads (except  in special circumstances) for reasons of  traffic 

safety and to maintain the capacity and efficiency of the road system. Council is normally responsible 

for the acquisition and construction of sub-arterial roads.  

########Page214 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
 
 
“Town  Centre  Streets”  are  roads  marked  as  such  on  the  Precinct  Road  Hierarchy  figure  in  the 

relevant  Precinct  Schedule.    They  are  specially  designed  to  create  a  pleasant  and  comfortable 

pedestrian environment. Amenity and safety is to be maintained through wide shaded footpaths, traffic 

calming measures and pedestrian crossings.  

“Walking Distance” is typically 400m or a 5 minute walk from a local destination or bus stop, or 800m 

or a 10 minute walk from a train station.  

“Zero  Lot  Line  Dwelling”  is  a  building  containing  one  dwelling,  on  a  single  block  of  land,  that  is

Introduction 

This Salinity Management Guideline contains background information, salinity risk mapping and management 

recommendations to control the effects of urban dryland salinity for proposed residential development within 

the Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Plan (East Leppington) in the South West Growth Centre.  

This Management Plan is based on the findings of relevant studies undertaken for Precinct Planning, relevant 

guidelines and policies in relation to urban salinity management and examples of salinity management plans 

prepared for other western Sydney urban release areas.  In particular, these guidelines adopt the  approach 

taken in the Salinity Management Plan prepared for the Second Ponds Creek release area in north-western 

Sydney.  This guideline includes: 

 

 

 

general information on the causes and effects of urban salinity; 

findings and conclusions from GeoEnviro’s Geotechnical, Salinity and Acid Sulphate Soil Investigation 

for the Austral and Leppington North Precincts (2011). 

Recommendations, measures and general guidelines for site development and construction, covering 

water management, site development and buildings. 

The aim of this guideline is to present practical recommendations about how to manage and, where possible, 

mitigate the existing saline conditions on site, so as to: 

 

 

limit any impact of salinity on roads, buildings, vegetation, underground services, water courses and 

storages; and 

limit the impacts of development in the precinct on the processes of salinity and the impacts of salinity 

on the environment. 

1.1  Background 

1.1.1  Proposed Development 

Planning  for  South  West  Growth  Centre  is  expected  to  provide  for  up  to  110,000  new  homes,  developing 

progressively over the next 25 to 30 years, together with essential facilities and open space. The Precincts will 

be  supported  by  Town  Centres  and  smaller  neighbourhood  centres  will  provide  local  retail  and  community 

services. Several infrastructure upgrades are planned including new road crossings and the South West Rail 

Link which will improve regional links to surrounding areas. 

1.1.2  Salinity Risk Maps 

A review of the Department of Natural Resources Map of Salinity Potential in Western Sydney (2002) indicates 

that much of the South West Growth Centre is prone to salinity risks to varying degrees, including significant 

areas  that  are  classified  as  either  Moderate  or  High  Salinity  Risk.    The  general  risk  assessment  has  been 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page221 

 
supplemented by specific salinity risk assessments for Growth Centre Precincts that have been released for 

Precinct Planning. 

1.2  The Causes of Urban Salinity 

Soils containing salts occur naturally in western Sydney due to underlying geological formations. In undisturbed 

areas  the  salts  are  generally  stored  below  the  plant  root  zone  where  they  have  minimal  impact.  The 

development of Western Sydney has disturbed the soil profile, altered hydrological processes and, in some 

areas, led to concentrations of salts on soil surfaces, in building materials, and waterways. Some Precincts are 

located within an area that is predisposed to developing salinity issues. 

Although  saline  soils  and  groundwater  are  a  natural  part  of  the  Australian  landscape,  land  management 

practices are now increasingly recognised as significant contributors to the expansion of salt affected areas. In 

particular, urban salinity is increasingly occurring around populated areas due to clearing and site development. 

Salinity  occurs  when  salts  found  naturally  in  the  soil  or  groundwater  are  mobilised.  Capillary  rise  and 

evaporation concentrate the salt on, and close to, the ground surface. Urban salinity becomes a problem when 

the natural hydrogeological balance is disturbed by human interaction. This may occur in urban areas due to 

changes  to  the  water  balance,  increases  in  the  volume  of  water  into  a  natural  system  altering  subsurface 

groundwater flows and levels, exposure of saline soils, and removal of deep rooted vegetation reducing rates 

of  evapotranspiration.  Even  small  changes  in  sensitive  areas  can  result  in  the  balance  being  irrecoverably 

altered and salinisation occurring. 

Some building methods may also contribute to the process of urban salinity. In particular, compacted surfaces 

and filling can restrict groundwater flow and result in a concentration of salt in one area. Cutting into slopes for 

building  can  result  in  saline  soils  or  ground  water  being  exposed  and  intercepted.    The  use  of  imported  fill 

material may be an additional source of salt or the filling may be less permeable, preventing good drainage. 

These issues may also result in problems with the design and construction of roads. In particular, the building 

of  embankments  and  the  compaction  of  layers  can  interfere  with  groundwater  flow.  Also  the  inappropriate 

positioning,  grading  and  construction  of  drains  can  result  in  surface  and  groundwater  mixing  and  stagnant 

pools forming that evaporate leaving salt encrusted ground. 

Salinity  issues may also  arise as the result of cumulative  impacts. A common example  is from the  gradual 

removal of vegetation across a site, which can contribute to a change in the hydrological regime from reduced 

evapotranspiration, a consequential rise in the ground water table, and subsequent salinity problems. Where 

vegetation is gradually removed the water table rises as a result of a smaller volume of water being used by 

the  plants,  allowing  salts  to  be  mobilised.  Of  more  relevance  in  an  urban  landscape  is  the  potential  for  an 

increase in water inputs into the hydrological regime. These increased inputs commonly come from watering 

of gardens and playing fields, infiltration of storm water and sewage and other service leakage. 

These  inputs  may  seem  minor  on  their  own  but  their  cumulative  effects  over  time  produce  an  elevated 

groundwater table and eventually high levels of salinity.  

########Page222 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
Figure 1 (from "Good Housekeeping to Manage Urban Salinity" by the Department of Infrastructure Planning 

and Natural Resources) illustrates the urban salinity process and identifies situations where salinity problems 

can develop due to inappropriate planning and design. 

Figure 1: The Urban Salinity Process (DIPNR) 

1.3  Effects of Salinity in an Urban Environment 

Excess salinity in an urban environment can result in significant problems. It can manifest itself in a number of 

ways.  

The effects of salinity can be observed in damage to building materials, infrastructure including pipework and 

roads and in death or poor health of vegetation. The effect of urban salinity is the result of both physical and 

chemical actions of the salt on concrete, bricks and metals. Salt moves into the pores of concrete and bricks 

and becomes concentrated when the water evaporates and can result in breakdown of materials and corrosion. 

Evidence of this may include crumbling, eroding or powdering of mortar or bricks, flaking of brick facing and 

cracking or corrosion of bricks. 

High levels of salinity can result in damage to and even death of plants. Signs that vegetation is under stress 

from salinity include the discolouration and wilting of leaves and the death of less salt tolerant plant species. It 

may also be hard to establish lawns in areas that are subject to high salinity. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page223 

 
 
High levels of salinity may also affect soil structure, chemistry and productivity. This can reduce plant growth 

which in turn alters soil structure, chemistry and nutrient levels. As soils become more saline, plants and micro-

organisms decline and soil structure deteriorates. 

Water logging may also occur following a decline in nutrient levels. Over time, the alteration of soil structure 

can lead to the formation of gullies and other forms of soil erosion. 

Salinity  may  also  result  in  the  corrosion  of  steel  pipes,  structural  steel  and  reinforcement  and  can  damage 

underground service pipes resulting in significant financial costs. 

While limited groundwater was observed during the site investigations, these conditions may potentially change 

in  periods  of  heavy  downpour.  Damage  to  pipes  has  the  potential  to  exacerbate  the  problem  by  further 

recharging the aquifer. 

Salinity can also have a significant effect on buildings and associated infrastructure where cutting and filling 

exposes buildings/structures to elevated salinity levels. This may include: 

 

 

 

 

degradation  of  bricks,  concrete,  road  base  and  kerbing  materials  leading  to  expansion,  cracking, 

strength and mass loss; 

corrosion of reinforcement and loss of structural integrity; 

rising/falling damp; and 

non-structural impacts, such as efflorescence on bricks. 

These impacts can be prevented, minimised, or mitigated by the implementation of appropriate management 

measures as outlined in the Salinity Management Plan in Section 3.

Salinity Hazard Assessment 

Salinity assessments undertaken as part of Precinct Planning are based on broad scale analysis of potential 

salinity  risks  including  limited  field  sampling.  These  results  are  based  on  limited  sampling  and  the  findings 

summarised in this section are indicative only of salinity  conditions in the precinct.  Further detailed salinity 

assessment investigation is required across much of the Precincts to confirm salinity conditions and to identify 

appropriate management measures.  

Salinity risk varies across the Growth Centres, and is often related to elevation, topography and the presence 

of watercourses.  Saline groundwater is also an issue in most locations, although depth to ground water (below 

current surface level) varies considerably.  

2.1  Salinity Risk Map  

A Salinity Risk Map is included in the Campbelltown Growth Centres Precinct (East Leppington) DCP and is 

divided into: 

 

 

Low  Risk  Areas:  The  salinity  of  the  area  is  considered  typical  of  western  Sydney.  Precautionary 

measures may be considered. 

Moderate or High Risk Areas: The salinity risk of the area is considered typical for creek line, floodplain 

or other low relief areas in western Sydney. These areas have a moderate or high risk of being affected 

by salinity and precautionary measures should be taken. 

In addition, areas of mild to moderately aggressive soils may be indicated on the map. Precautionary measures 

must be taken in these areas and these are discussed in Section 3.4. 

Note: Studies are by no means detailed or comprehensive. Maps are an indication only and site specific studies 
at  the  DA  stage  are  required  (as  specified  by  this  DCP)  to  determine  salinity  conditions  and  appropriate 
management measures.

3.2  General Measures 

The following general measures apply to all development within  the  Campbelltown  Growth Centre  Precinct 

(East  Leppington).  Where  there  is  an  inconsistency,  the  specific  controls  in  the  following  sections  take 

precedence. All development should be in line with the Western Sydney Salinity Code of Practice 2004. 

Note that the practices for managing salinity will differ depending on the type of land use that is proposed on 

the site. For example, practices for land zoned Open Space and Recreation will require different approaches 

than practices within the Local Centre and residential zones.  

1. 

Filling areas are to be graded, revegetated and adequate surface drainage infrastructure installed as 

soon as practical to avoid excessive infiltration, minimise salt leaching and soil erosion. 

2. 

Drainage infrastructure in vulnerable areas is to be installed as soon as practical to avoid excessive 

water infiltration, ponding of water on-site and salt leaching. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8. 

Watering or irrigation practices are to be managed to avoid excessive infiltration and water logging. 

Pipes used for stormwater drainage should be sealed to minimise the risk of leakage. 

Concrete  of  suitable  strength  and  reinforcement  cover  is  to  be  used  for  drainage  structures  and 

wherever contact with water and increased soil moisture is expected. 

Exposure and disturbance of subsoil material must be reduced by minimising cut and fill. 

Natural drainage patterns are to be maintained as far as practical. 

Imported soil should be tested for salinity to avoid importing saline soils to the site. 

########Page226 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
9. 

Native  plant  species  with  minimal  water  requirements,  tolerant  to  EC  levels  of  4000μS/cm  to  be 

selected for revegetation or plantings. 

10. 

Drainage,  sewerage  and  water  infrastructure  is  to  be  regularly  maintained  and  repaired  to  prevent 

leakages. 

11. 

Groundwater extraction does not occur on the site. 

12. 

Design and construction to be carried out in accordance with relevant Australian Standards, Building 

Codes and current ‘Industry Best Practice’ in regard to urban salinity. 

13. 

Any imported fill must have its salinity levels tested and must not exceed a level of 2 deci-siemens per 

centimetre. Soils exceeding this level must not be imported onto the site. 

14. 

Reversing or mixing the soil profile when undertaking cut and fill activities must be avoided. Soils must 

be replaced in their original order. 

15. 

Native vegetation must be retained or restored on sire where possible. 

16. 

In seepage and discharge areas or areas with a high potential sulphate resistant building materials 

must be used. 

17. 

In areas with sodic or saline B Horizons disturbance to the soil should be reduced and the exposure 

of  building  materials  to  the  corrosive  elements  in  these  soils  minimised.  Appropriate  construction 

techniques such as suspended slab or piering to encourage ventilation and prevent soil moisture from 

being forced up the walls of the structure should be used. 

18. 

In case of all building materials the manufacturer’s advice must be complied with regarding durability 

and correct use. 

19. 

Sulphate resistant materials should be used for underground surfaces and roads or paving. 

20. 

Roads must have well designed sub surface drainage. 

21. 

Roads and shoulder areas must be designed to drain surface water such that there is no excessive 

concentration  of  runoff  or  ponding  which  may  result  in  water  logging  or  additional  recharge  or 

groundwater. Road shoulders must also be sealed. 

22. 

Surface drains should be provided along the top of batter slopes or greater than 2.5 metres height to 

reduce the potential for concentrated flows of water flows slopes which may cause scour. Well graded 

subsoil should be provided at the base of all slopes where there are road pavements below the slope 

to reduce the risk of water logging. 

23. 

The addition of salts in the materials, fill or water used during construction must be limited. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page227 

 
24. 

A waterproof seal must be used on roads to minimise evaporation and the concentration of salt. 

25. 

Road alignments should not intercept known salt affected or water logged areas. 

26. 

Roads should not be designed in a manner that impedes the sub-soil flow or creates hydraulic pressure 

causing groundwater discharge. 

27. 

Natural drainage patterns and infiltration rates must be maintained as far as practicable. 

28. 

Drainage should not be designed to discharge to groundwater or salinity affected areas that is likely to 

cause increased water logging adjacent to the road or that concentrated surface runoff. 

29. 

Detention  basins  and  other  measures  must  not  leek  and  cause  localised  damp  soil  conditions  or 

recharge to the groundwater. 

30. 

Stormwater detention structures and other measures must be constructed with impermeable liners and 

avoid the infiltration of water into the surrounding landscape or groundwater above that which would 

naturally  occur.  If  using  a  clay  lining  the  possibility  that  on  site  clays  may  be  saline  should  be 

investigated before they are used for this purpose. In there situations an impermeable geotech fabric 

may be preferable. 

31. 

Materials and waters used in the construction of roads and fill embankments should be selected to 

contain minimal or no salt. Where it is difficult a capping layer of either topsoil or sandy materials should 

be placed to reduce capillary rise, act as a drainage layer and also reduce the potential for dispersive 

behaviour in the sodic soils. 

32. 

Batter slopes should be compacted with control of the moisture content to optimum moisture content 

plus 2 per cent or otherwise over-filled, compacted and then trimmed back to the final alignment to 

minimise infiltration through the exposed filling betters and the potential resulting flushing of salts from 

the  filling.  If  the  later  is  to  be  carried  out,  the  outer  zone  (3  metres)  of  the  fill  should  be  placed  at 

optimum moisture content plus 2 per cent. 

3.3  Groundwater Management 

The key to controlling salinity is to minimise the concentration of salinity by evaporative processes. Care should 

also  be  taken  to  avoid  raising  the  groundwater  tables,  as  this  is  likely  to  result  in  an  increased  surface 

expression  of  salinity  and  may  lead  to  water  logging  and  groundwater  infiltration  into  underground 

infrastructure. 

1. 

Some general measures to reduce the volume of discharge into the aquifer and reduce risk of rising 

groundwater tables are: 

2. 

3. 

Avoid over-watering of lawns, parks and other landscaped areas. 

Minimise the number of shallow open pools that can readily dry out; 

########Page228 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
4. 

Plant native vegetation that utilises rainfall efficiently and minimise lawn areas on land not required for 

recreational uses.  Landscape with native trees, shrubs and grasses that require little irrigation. 

5. 

Appropriate design, construction and maintenance of water supply, sewage and stormwater pipes to 

avoid leaking. 

6. 

Ensure an appropriate ratio of hard (impermeable) and permeable surfaces to avoid rainwater runoff 

infiltrating the ground in large volumes at any given location. 

7. 

Direct  runoff  from  paved  areas  into  lines  stormwater  drains  rather  than  along  grassed  channels  as 

necessary. 

8. 

Line or locate any ponds higher in the landscape to avoid recharge where proximity to the water table 

is likely to create groundwater mounding. 

9. 

Avoid or minimise the use of on site stormwater detention. 

10. 

Ensure any trunk stormwater detention infrastructure is appropriately designed and constructed. 

11. 

Ensure adequate surface drainage for all development, including proper geotechnical assessments of 

planned drainage basins, artificial wetlands and recreational waterbodies. 

3.4  High Risk Areas 

In areas identified as having a high salinity risk (refer to Section 2 of this DCP and Figure 2-4) or site specific 

studies or for development in close proximity to creek lines the following measures must be taken: 

1. 

Detailed sampling and testing of soils and groundwater is required to confirm current salinity conditions 

and identify any risks that may be posed by development, as part of the design of subdivisions.   A 

salinity assessment report is to be submitted with subdivision DA’s in high risk areas. 

2. 

Reduced development densities are to be considered to reduce pressure on groundwater in catchment 

areas. 

3. 

Unless site specific testing shows otherwise and/ or other management measures can be shown to 

achieve sufficient protection, floor slabs are to: 

  be elevated above ground level; and  

  have a minimum concrete strength of 32MPs. 

Existing riparian corridors are to be maintained and revegetated. 

Detailed  salinity  investigations  are  to  be  undertaken  prior  to  development  or  the  installation  of 

infrastructure and the recommended management measures are to be implemented. 

4. 

5. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

########Page229 

 
3.5  Site Design  

Control methods for management of salinity during site development should start with adherence to careful 

stripping  and  separation  of  non-saline  topsoil  from  slightly  and  moderately  saline  subsoils.  Soils  must  be 

replaced in the original order where possible to avoid bringing salts to the surface. 

The  A  and  top  of  the  B  (i.e.  B1)  horizon  are  generally  not  saline  and  should  be  recovered  and  stockpiled 

separately. The lower B (i.e. B2) and C horizons are generally the more saline layers and where exposed need 

to be covered with say 100 - 200 mm of B1 then 100 - 200 mm of topsoil (A) for landscape finishes. Building 

platforms should be capped with 100 - 200 mm of B1 horizon non saline subsoil. 

Precautionary measures in subdivision design to reduce the potential for salinity problems include: 

1.  avoiding water collecting in low lying areas, along shallow creeks, floodways, in ponds, depressions, or 

behind fill embankments or near trenches on the uphill sides of roads. This can lead to water logging of 

the  soils,  evaporative  concentration  of  salts,  and  eventual  breakdown  in  soil  structure  resulting  in 

accelerated erosion; 

2. 

roads and the shoulder areas should be designed to be well drained, particularly with regard to drainage 

of surface water. There should not be excessive concentrations of runoff or ponding that would lead to 

water  logging  of  the  pavement  or  additional  recharge  to  the  groundwater.  Road  shoulders  should  be 

included in the sealing program; 

3. 

surface drains should generally be provided along the top of batter slopes of greater than 2.5 m height to 

reduce  the potential for concentrated flows of  water  down slopes  possibly  causing scour. Well graded 

subsoil drainage should be provided at the base of all slopes where there are road pavements below the 

slope to reduce the risk of water logging; 

4.  where possible materials and waters used in the construction of roads and fill embankments should be 

selected to contain minimal or no salt. This may be difficult for cuts and fills in lower areas where saline 

soils are exposed in cut or excavated then placed as filling. Under these circumstances where salinisation 

could  be  a  problem,  a  capping  layer  of  either  topsoil  or  sandy  materials  should  be  placed  to  reduce 

capillary rise, act as a drainage layer and also reduce the potential for dispersive behaviour in the sodic 

soils; 

5. 

to minimise infiltration through the exposed filling batters and the potential resulting flushing of salts from 

the filling, it is suggested that the batter slopes be specifically compacted to the requirements as described 

above but with control of the moisture content to OMC + 2% or otherwise over-filled, compacted and then 

trimmed back to the final alignment. If the later is to be carried out, the outer zone (say 3 m wide) of the 

filling should be placed at OMC + 2%; 

6.  gypsum  should  be  mixed  into  filling  containing  sodic  soils  and  cuts  where  sodic  soils  are  exposed  on 

slopes to improve soil structure and to minimise erosion potential; 

########Page230 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
7. 

consideration could be given to planning to use deeper infrastructure service lines, deeper than say 1.2 

m, to promote subsurface drainage by incorporating slotted drainage pipes fitting into the stormwater pits 

in lower areas where pipe invert levels are within about 1 m of existing groundwater levels. This is probably 

likely to be more appropriate where good drainage can be planned as in certain situations poorly graded 

subsoil drainage and water collecting in pits may make things worse raising the water table and increasing 

the risk of salinisation; 

8. 

salt tolerant grasses and trees should be considered  close to the creek and in areas of moderate and 

greater salinity to reduce soil erosion and to stabilise the soils and creek banks as well as maintain the 

existing  evapotranspiration  and  groundwater  levels.  Reference  should  be  made  to  an  experienced 

landscape planner or agronomist. Advice from landscape technologists is that a wide range of indigenous 

and native species are available that will tolerate the anticipated level of salinity. 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013

3.6  Residential and Other Buildings 

Figure 3 presents diagrammatically a selection of salinity management tips for domestic dwellings. 

The  extent  of  measures  adopted  during  construction  in  particular  the  concrete  and  masonry  requirements 

should depend on the particular level of salinity of aggressivity at the actual site. Based on measurements and 

observations to date, it is anticipated that extreme salinity protection measures, such as increased durability 

concrete,  barrier  membranes,  pier  and  beam,  etc  will  not  be  required  over  most  of  the  building  areas. 

Nevertheless, for the construction of buildings on moderately or more saline sites, the following controls are to 

be implemented:  

1.  Soil  from  building  sites  in  areas  suspected  to  be  more  than  slightly  saline  (ECe  >  4  dS/m)  should  be 

sampled, tested and classified for soil salinity and aggressivity. This should preferably be carried out by a 

geotechnical consultant at the same time the site is classified for soil reactivity (shrink – swell behaviour 

as described in Australian Standard 2870 – 1996 Residential slabs and footings). The salinity classification 

would  involve  limited  additional  testing  of  soil  or  water  samples  for  pH,  electrical  conductivity,  total 

dissolved solids (TDS), sodicity, and possibly sulphates and chlorides.  

2.  On moderately or more saline sites, a thick layer of sand (say 100 mm minimum) followed by a membrane 

of thick plastic should be placed under the concrete slab to act as a moisture barrier and drainage layer 

to restrict capillary rise under the slab. Alternatively concrete grade of at least N25 and minimum 45 mm 

reinforcement cover should be adequate in moderately saline areas increasing to N32 and 50 mm cover 

respectively for very saline (ECe from 8 to 16 dS/m) areas. 

3.  The  need  for  higher  than  normal  strength  concrete  and  use  of  sulphate  resistant  cement  should  be 

considered in potentially highly saline (ECe > 16 dS/m) or aggressive areas in order to reduce the risk 

reinforcement corrosion in concrete slabs. A minimum of 55 mm of concrete cover on slab reinforcement, 

proper compaction and curing concrete are also suggested to produce a dense low permeability concrete. 

4.  As an alternative to slab on ground construction, suspended slab or pier and beam construction should 

be considered, particularly on sloping sites as this will minimise exposure to potentially corrosive soils and 

reduce the potential cut and fill on site which could alter subsurface flows. 

5.  Other measures that can be considered to improve the durability of concrete in saline environments should 

be considered. These include reducing the  water cement ratio (hence  increasing strength), minimising 

cracks and joins in plumbing on or near the concrete, reducing turbulence of any water flowing over the 

concrete and using a quality assurance supplier. 

6. 

It is essential that in all masonry buildings that a brick damp course be properly installed so that it cannot 

be bridged either internally or externally. This will prevent moisture moving into brick work and up the wall. 

7.  As  there  are  various  exposure  classifications  and  durability  ratings  for  the  wide  range  of  masonry 

available, reference should be made to the supplier in choosing suitable bricks of at least exposure quality. 

Water proofing agents can also be added to mortar to further restrict potential water movement. 

########Page232 

Campbelltown Growth Centre Precinct Development Control Plan 2013 

 
8. 

In high salinity areas, bricks that are not susceptible to damage from salt water should be used. These 

are  generally  less  permeable,  do  not  contain  salts  during  their  construction  and  have  good  internal 

strength so that they can withstand any stress imposed on them by any salt encrustation. 

9.  As indicated on Figure 3, service connections and stormwater runoffs should be checked to avoid leaky 

pipes which may affect off site areas lower down the slope and increase groundwater recharge resulting 

in increases in groundwater levels.
