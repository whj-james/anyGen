1A Introduction

1A.1 Preamble

1A.4 Strategic Context

This Development Control Plan (DCP) applies to all land 
within the Hornsby Local Government Area. The plan is 
called the Hornsby Development Control Plan 2013.

1A.2 Commencement Date

This DCP was adopted by Council on 19 December 2012 
and came into effect on 11 October 2013. It is subject to 
amendments, which are listed in the Schedule of 
Amendments at the end of this part. 

1A.3 Objectives

The objectives of this DCP are to:

 provide a comprehensive document that provides a 

framework for development of land in the Hornsby Local 
Government Area,

 clearly set out the processes, procedures and 

responsibilities for the involvement of the community 
and key stakeholders in the development of land,

 promote development that is consistent with Council’s 

vision of creating a living environment,

 protect and enhance the natural and built environment, 
and ensure that satisfactory measures are incorporated 
to ameliorate any impacts arising from development,

 encourage high quality development that contributes to 
the existing or desired future character of the area, with 
particular emphasis on the integration of buildings with 
a landscaped setting,

 protect and enhance the public domain,

 minimise risk to the community, and

 ensure that development incorporates the principles of 

Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD).

Note: 

For further information on Council’s vision of creating a living 
environment, refer to Hornsby Shire 2020 - Framework for a 
Sustainable Future available on Council’s website 
hornsby.nsw.gov.au

a. The planning controls promote development that is 
consistent with Council’s vision of ‘creating a living 
environment’ for a sustainable Hornsby Shire. The 
planning controls within this DCP are informed by a 
number of studies and adopted strategies including 
the following: 

Hornsby Shire Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (2006)

b. The objectives of the Hornsby Shire Biodiversity 
Conservation Strategy include to achieve an 
improvement in the quality and extent of existing 
indigenous vegetation in Hornsby Shire, maintain 
biodiversity on private properties, and to conserve and 
recreate biodiversity connectivity across fragmented 
landscapes.

Hornsby Shire Sustainable Total Water Cycle Management 
Strategy (2005)

c.  The Hornsby Shire Sustainable Total Water Cycle 

Management Strategy promotes the implementation of 
sustainable total water cycle management. Sustainable 
water practices include:

 maintenance of natural water courses,

 adoption of current best management practices to 

reduce the quantity and improve the quality of runoff, 
and

 minimised use of reticulated water through 

conservation practices and reuse of stormwater.

Hornsby Integrated Land Use and Transport Strategy 
(ILUTS) (2005)

d. An objective of ILUTS is to reduce car travel by 

promoting other modes of transport. This includes 
promoting land use patterns and development controls 
that support the development of public transport 
services and the use of sustainable alternatives.  

Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Subregional Employment Study 
(2008) 

e. The objectives of the Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby 

Subregional Employment Study include to develop 
planning controls for employment lands consistent with 
the current strategic planning guidance. This includes to 
ensure that the distribution of additional jobs supports 
existing centres, and that employment lands are 
accessible to residents and workers and are linked into 
the transport network.

1-4

Hornsby Shire Housing Strategy (2010) 

1A.5 Relationship to other plans 

f.  The Hornsby Shire Housing Strategy identifies areas 

suitable for the provision of additional housing to assist 
meet Council’s housing obligations into the future. The 
Strategy has been prepared in response to the State 
Government’s Metropolitan Strategy and draft North 
Subregional Strategy.

g. A concentrated housing model has been adopted, with 

housing located in planned precincts rather than 
dispersed throughout urban areas. The housing form 
identified includes some mixed use commercial 
precincts and consists predominantly of 5 storey 
apartment buildings, along with a mix of townhouses, 3 
storey walk-up flats, and 8-10 storey apartments. The 
Housing Strategy precincts are identified in Figure 3(a) 
of this DCP.

Hornsby Shire River Settlements and Foreshores Review  
(2007)

h. The Hornsby Shire River Settlements and Foreshores 
Review investigated the suitability of the existing 
planning controls for the River Settlement areas having 
regard to emerging issues and current best practices.  

Hornsby Shire Rural Lands Study (1995) and Hornsby Shire 
Rural Lands Planning Provisions Review (2009)

i.  The Hornsby Shire Rural Lands Study investigates the 

role of rural lands within the Local Government Area and 
provides controls for development to improve the 
environment. Development should aim to protect rural 
activities, resource lands, rural landscapes and 
biodiversity. To conserve the desirable values of the rural 
lands, the Study (1995) identified the qualities which 
give the areas its scenic and rural character.

Epping Town Centre Precinct and the Urban Activation 
Precinct Program

j.  The planning controls within this DCP are also informed 
by the Epping Town Centre Study 2011 and the Epping 
Town Centre Precinct Structure Plan and Public Domain 
Plan 2013 prepared for the Precinct by the then 
Department of Planning and Infrastructure. 

and policies

a. This DCP is made under Section 74C of the 

Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 
(EP&A Act).

b. This DCP must be read in conjunction with an 

environmental planning instrument (EPI) that applies to 
the land. EPIs include local environmental plans (LEP) 
and state environmental planning policies (SEPP).  

c.  The Hornsby L-ocal Environmental Plan 2013 (HLEP) is 
the only local environmental planning instrument that 
applies to land to which this DCP applies. A number of 
State Environmental Planning Policies (SEPPs) may also 
apply to a development application. The provisions of 
any EPI prevail in the event of any inconsistency with 
this DCP.

d. Section 1B.6 prescribes trees or other vegetation for the 

purpose of Clause 5.9 of the HLEP.

1A.6 Development contributions and 

planning agreements

a. Some developments generate the need for 

development contributions where they result in an 
increase in the demand for community services and 
infrastructure. These developments will also need to 
address:

 The Hornsby Shire Council Section 94 Development 

Contributions Plan 2012-2021.

 The Hornsby Shire Council Section 94A Development 

Contributions Plan 2012-2021

b. Planning agreements may also be made in accordance 

with the requirements of the EP&A Act and are 
voluntary agreements between Council and an applicant 
for development.   

Note:  

The above Development Contributions Plans are available for 
viewing on Council’s website hornsby.nsw.gov.au

Consideration of an Application for Tree Work 

Works on land identified as “Biodiversity” on the HLEP Terrestrial 
Biodiversity Map should have regard to Section 1C.1.1 Biodiversity 
of this DCP.

Works involving heritage items and heritage conservation areas 
should also have regard to Part 9 Heritage of this DCP.

Section 12 of the Vegetation SEPP provides that the applicant for 
a permit may appeal to the Land and Environment Court against 
refusal by a Council to grant a permit.  Any such appeal is to 
be made within 3 months of the date on which the applicant is 
notified of the decision or within 3 months after the Council is 
taken to have refused the application (whichever is later). 

i.  The removal of, or work to, trees should be consistent 
with the applicable provisions of the Vegetation SEPP, 
HLEP and HDCP.

The Biodiversity Offset Scheme (BOS) includes a Sensitive 
Biodiversity Values (SBV) Map and Area Threshold. If either criteria 
is met then the offsets scheme must be applied unless it is 
subject to a listed exemption. 

j.  Trees will be assessed using arboricultural, ecological 
and industry accepted safety evaluation methods to 
determine the safe useful life expectancy of the trees. 
Accordingly, any application for removal must 
demonstrate that the removal of the tree is appropriate 
based on an assessment of the safe useful life and risk 
to human life or property using industry relevant risk 
assessment such as Tree Risk Assessment Qualification 
(TRAQ) or Qualified Tree Risk Assessment (QTRA).

k.  Where trees are to be retained, the provisions of 

Australian Standard AS 4970 Protection of Trees on 
Development Sites must be applied.

The SBV Map has been prepared as part of the BOS and may be 
viewed on the OEH website www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.

of Amenity Trees.

m. Any tree approved to be removed from a site should be 

replaced with a tree of like habit and indigenous to 
Hornsby Shire, planted as near as practicable to the 
location of the removed tree, grown to maturity and 
replaced if the planting fails to survive and thrive in 
accordance with Council’s Green Offsets Code.

demonstrate that the removal of vegetation is 
appropriate based on an assessment of the:

 conservation significance/health/longevity  

of the vegetation; and

 risk to human life or property.

Notes: 

The clearing of native vegetation that is exempt in Table 1B.6.2(a) 
is to facilitate minor development such as sheds ancillary to 
dwellings that may be otherwise permissible under SEPP 
(Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008. The intent is 
not to allow extensive bushland removal.

Works on land identified as “Biodiversity” on the HLEP 
Terrestrial Biodiversity Map should have regard to Section 1C.1.1 
Biodiversity of this DCP.

Works involving heritage items and heritage conservation areas 
should also have regard to Part 9 Heritage of this DCP.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | GENERAL
(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 31 MAY 2019)

1-19

Trees play an important role in the ‘greening’ of our city. 
They make our surroundings pleasant, provide relief from 
summer heat and reduce glare from the pavement. They 
also increase the value of real estate, reduce runoff and 
improve the quality of the air we breathe. 

Council considers it important to carefully manage this 
precious resource and to preserve the existing urban 
forest within the City of Parramatta LGA for the purpose of 
establishing green corridors and maintaining the natural 
aesthetic values within the urban environment. 

Trees on sites listed on the New South Wales State 
Heritage Register require Heritage Council approval or 
exemption from this approval prior to any pruning or 
proposed removal. Exemptions may be granted for pruning 
up to 30% of the canopy of a tree on a State Heritage 
Register-listed site within a two year period. More 
information on Heritage Council approvals and exemptions 
is available online at www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/
development. 

Objectives

of any inconsistency in relation to trees and vegetation 
in City of Parramatta LGA, take precedence over the 
controls in other sections of this DCP. 

c.  All references to Acts, Regulations, Codes, Australian 

Standards, Plans, policies, the Technical Manual and the 
Guide are to those documents as amended over time. 

Note: Under State Environmental Planning Policy (Vegetation in 
Non-Rural Areas) 2017, clearing of native vegetation, including 
trees, above a certain threshold triggers an alternate approval 
pathway through the Native Vegetation Panel. As at November 
2017 the threshold included clearing of more than 2,500sqm 
of native vegetation on a site, or the clearing of ANY native 
vegetation on sites identified by the Office of Environment and 
Heritage as having high biodiversity value on the Biodiversity 
Value Map (www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/BVMap). More information on 
the Policy and the Native Vegetation Panel is available online at 
www.planning.nsw.gov.au/VegetationSEPP.

1B.7.1  Tree Preservation - land within the  

  City of Parramatta LGA

 To maintain and enhance the amenity of City of 

Prescribed Trees 

Parramatta LGA through the preservation of appropriate 
trees and vegetation. 

 To retain City of Parramatta LGA’s urban forest cover 

particularly its street tree and parkland tree population 
to alleviate urban heat impact. 

 To appropriately manage trees and vegetation in order 

to ensure their health and long term retention. 

 To conserve trees of ecological, heritage, aesthetic and 

cultural significance.

 To protect and manage individual trees as an important 

community asset. 

 To establish the procedural framework and 

requirements governing the pruning, removal and 
subsequent replacement of trees within the City. 

 To ensure all new development considers and protects 

existing trees on development sites and provides 
opportunity for the healthy growth of large trees. 

How to use this section

a. This section is to be read in conjunction with State 

Environmental Planning Policy (Vegetation in Non-Rural 
Areas) 2017.  

b. Other sections of Hornsby Development Control Plan 
2013 may also be relevant considerations, including 
Biodiversity and other natural environment controls in 
Section 1C.1. The controls in this section, to the extent 

a. The prescribed trees to which Part 3 of State 

Environmental Planning Policy (Vegetation in Non-Rural 
Areas) 2017 and the controls in this section apply 
include: 

 Any tree or palm – whether indigenous, endemic, exotic 

or introduced species - with a height equal to or 
exceeding 5 metres.

 Any tree or mangrove vegetation located on public land, 

irrespective of size.

 Any tree or plant, irrespective of size:

i.  that is or forms part of a heritage item, or that is 

within a heritage conservation area; or

ii.  that is or forms part of an Aboriginal object, or that is 
within an Aboriginal place of heritage significance.

Penalties

b. A person found guilty of an offence for a contravention 
of these controls may be issued a penalty infringement 
notice not exceeding $3,000 for individuals, $6,000 for 
companies, fined up to $110,000 if dealt with in the 
Local Court or up to $1,100,000 if dealt with in the Land 
& Environment Court. 

c.  In addition to a penalty awarded, the Court may also 

order the repair, remedial pruning or replacement of a 
damaged or removed tree and impose an order to 
maintain such replacement to maturity.

1-20

d. The Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 also provides for 
additional penalties that may be imposed for offences 
relating to the harming or damaging of protected or 
threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. 
Maximum penalties include fines and imprisonment.

Tree Permit 

This section explains which tree works require a tree 
permit and sets out the controls for these works. 

Controls

e. A tree permit must be obtained before any tree works 
are carried out on a prescribed tree, including its root 
zone. An arboricultural report and other reports and 
information, may be required to be submitted as part of 
the Tree Permit assessment process. 

f.  All tree works must be carried out in accordance with 
the WorkCover NSW Code of Practice: ‘Amenity Tree 
Industry’ - 1998. 

g. Trees removed as a consequence of approval by a tree 
permit may need to be replaced with a suitable canopy 
tree or trees in a suitable location on the site. 

Offset Program 

h. Should Council approve tree works, Council prefers that 
trees that are removed are replaced on the site with a 
suitable replacement canopy tree and in a suitable 
location onsite. However, there may be circumstances 
when there is no suitable location on site (for example, 
in the case of small backyards); in this case, a financial 
contribution will be required to be paid to support public 
tree planting. Offset fees are contained within City of 
Parramatta Council’s published fees and charges.

How an application is made 

i.  An application for consent to undertake tree works shall 
be made, using City of Parramatta Council’s Tree Permit 
Application, by all owners of the land on which the tree 
works are to be carried out or by any person with 
written consent of the owners. The application form 
must be completed and submitted to City of Parramatta 
Council together with the appropriate fee. 

j.  City of Parramatta’s Tree Permit Application form can be 

found online at www.cityofparramatta.nsw.gov.au/
living-and-community/trees.

Trees Considered to be Dangerous

k.  If a tree is considered to be:

native animals; or

 Posing an imminent risk to human life or property 
(see Clause 8(2) and 8(3) of State Environmental 
Planning Policy (Vegetation in Non-Rural Areas) 2017); 

a tree permit application is not required to be submitted  
to Council for the removal of that tree.

l.  Before any tree works are undertaken, Council must be 

satisfied that the tree is dead, dying or posing an 
imminent risk to human life or property. If satisfied, 
Council will issue a letter confirming that the tree is 
exempt from the requirement of a tree permit. Council 
may require a replacement tree be planted to ensure 
that in time this tree is replaced.

m. In determining if the tree is posing an imminent risk to 
human life or property, a tree risk assessment will be 
undertaken that will consider:

 Likelihood of failure

 Likelihood of impacting a target

 Consequences of impact.

Note: Section ‘Penalties’ sets out the penalties for persons 
found guilty of unlawfully clearing trees and vegetation without 
the necessary approvals. Sections ‘Exempt Works’ and ‘Exempt 
Pruning Works’ detail exemptions from a tree permit for tree 
works to be undertaken by the State Emergency Service or Rural 
Fire Service in response to emergency, severe natural event and 
other nominated circumstances.

Assessment Process

n. In considering a tree application, the Council shall 

consider the retention value of the tree through a 3 step 
process:

Step 1: Assess the sustainability of the tree in its 

location. This is determined by considering the vitality, 
structural condition, age/longevity and suitability of 
the tree to the site. 

Questions to be considered:

 Has the tree reached the end of its lifespan or is 

there evidence of decline?

 Does the tree show evidence of potential structural 
failure, and could become dangerous requiring it to 
be removed at a later date?

 Does the tree impact on a main area of private open 
space, so that it compromises the use of the open 
space for passive or active recreation?

 Is there evidence of damage to the tree due to pests 
or disease that will reduce the lifespan of the tree?

 Is there evidence that the tree is causing structural 

 Dead or dying and is not required as the habitat of 

damage to a building?

(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 31 MAY 2019)

1-21

 Is the species of tree suited to the location?

Step 2: Assess the landscape and amenity significance 
of the tree. This is determined by considering the 
amenity, heritage and environmental value of each 
tree.

Questions to be considered:

 Is the tree prominent in the streetscape?

 Does the tree have heritage significance or contribute 

to the significance of a place?

 Is the tree a contributory item to a heritage place or 

conservation area?

removed, however their replacement may be a 
requirement of removal. 

Neighbour’s Trees 

o. If a neighbour’s tree overhangs your property boundary, 

you may undertake pruning within your property 
boundary, provided it can be carried out in accordance 
with Australian Standard 4373 – 2007, ‘Pruning of 
Amenity Trees’ from within your property and you have 
obtained consent from Council prior to undertaking such 
works. A tree permit will be required for pruning works 
to prescribed trees on a neighbour’s property.

 Would the proposed works adversely affect the 

Consent Duration

heritage significance of a heritage item, Aboriginal 
object, Aboriginal places of heritage significance or 
heritage conservation area?

 Does the tree represent a typical planting of the era 
of the associated building or park’s construction or 
creation?

 Does the tree contribute to an established 

streetscape?

 Does the tree have high aesthetic value?

 Does the tree provide privacy screening value?  

 Is the tree an Indigenous or endemic species?

 Is the tree part of a remnant endemic collection of 

trees or vegetation?

 Does the tree have potential to provide a habitat for 

native fauna, including hollows or nests?

 Is the tree part of a threatened ecological community 
listed under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 or 
mapped on the OEH Biodiversity Values Map? If yes, 
a ‘Test of Significance’ or assessment under the 
Biodiversity Offset Scheme (BOS) may be required. 

  Where a tree is identified as part of a threatened 
ecological community under the Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 2016, Section 5AA of the 
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 
applies and a “Test of Significance” must be prepared 
by a qualified ecologist and submitted to Council with 
the application. 

Step 3: Consider sustainability and landscape 

significance together to determine the retention 
value.

 Trees will be categorised as having a high, medium, 

low or very low retention value.

 Trees with a high retention value or medium retention 

value should be considered for retention.

 Trees with a low retention value can usually be 

p. Consent issued by Council shall lapse if the works 

referred to in the consent have not been completed 
within two (2) years from the date of consent. 

q. Consent issued by Council in conjunction with a 

subdivision approval, a building approval, complying 
development or development consent shall lapse if 
these approvals or consents lapse or become invalid, 
void or are surrendered. 

r.  Consent for tree works associated with development 

may, if granted, be issued concurrently with the 
development application or complying development 
consent, but may also be subject to any landscaping and 
street scaping requirements or any conditions imposed 
under any relevant SEPP, LEP, DCP or other Council 
policy. 

s.  A copy of the consent must be kept on the site of the 
tree works and produced on demand to Council’s duly 
authorised officers, servants or agents. 

Issues which do not usually warrant removal / pruning of 
trees

 A tree shedding leaves, fruit, bark, cones twigs or 

minor dead wood.

 A tree is causing minor structural damage, such as 

footpaths or driveways.

 There are unsubstantiated fears about healthy trees 

failing.

 A tree is causing minor shading.

 A tree is causing blockage to pipes, unless the 
damage is serious and recurring. Root pruning, 
replacement of old dilapidated pipes, or use of root 
barriers may solve the problem (evidence would need 
to be provided if the problem is serious). 

 Pruning for amenity views.

1-22

 A tree that is dead or dying that provides habitat to 
native animals and is not posing a risk to human life 
or property.

 There are concerns about bush fire hazard, where the 
land is not within bush fire prone land as defined by 
Council’s Bush Fire Prone Land Map (removal of trees 
or other vegetation for bush fire hazard reduction is 
governed by the Rural Fires Act 1997).

Publicly Owned Land 

t.  The following provisions apply to applications for 

consent to prune or remove trees located on publicly 
owned land, including council parks, reserves and road 
reserves:

 City of Parramatta Council, or its duly authorised 
servants or agents, may carry out the pruning or 
removal of a tree/s including bushland vegetation 
from Council owned or controlled land. 

 All tree works conducted by Council will comply with 
relevant Australian Standards and specifications as 
determined by the Council policies. The cost of all 
non-essential tree works for trees located on public 
land will be the responsibility of the applicant. Council 
or an authorised agent will carry out any such 
approved works. 

 Where a Council Public Works project requires tree/s 
to be pruned or removed, consent must be sought at 
the planning stage in consultation with Council’s 
Open Space and Natural Resources Unit.

Exempt Tree Works

The following are exempt works and do not require a 
permit:

w. Part A: Exemptions applying to land under care, 

control, management of Council:

1C General Controls

The following section provides general controls for the 
protection of the environment and applies to all forms 
of development.

 groups of significant trees and vegetation, and

 mature hollow trees and other fauna habitat features 

on the site.

1C.1 Natural Environment 

1C.1.1 Biodiversity

HLEP Clause 6.4 contains provisions for development 
of land identified as Biodiversity on the Terrestrial 
Biodiversity Map. 
The following controls apply to land with biodiversity value, 
including land affected by the HLEP provisions.

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that provides for the conservation of 

biodiversity including threatened species and 
populations, endangered ecological communities, 
remnant indigenous trees, regionally and locally 
significant terrestial and aquatic vegetation.

b. Development that maintains habitat for native wildlife 
and wildlife corridors to provide for the movement of 
fauna species. 

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Development should seek to:

 avoid potential adverse impact on biodiversity, 

 if that impact cannot be avoided, minimise that 

impact, or

 if the impact cannot be minimised, to mitigate 

the impact.

b. A flora and fauna assessment is required for 

development that may impact on:

 land mapped as Biodiversity on the HLEP Terrestrial 

Biodiversity Map, or

 native vegetation which is habitat for species listed 
in Schedule 1, 1A or 2 of the Threatened Species 
Conservation Act 1995.

c.  Development should avoid the fragmentation of existing 

native vegetation.

d. Development should seek to retain unique 
environmental features of the site including:

 rock outcrops, 

 wetlands and the like,

 watercourses, drainage lines and riparian land, 

e. Development should incorporate and maintain a buffer 

zone to significant flora and fauna. Development should 
not include buildings, structures and earthworks within 
the required buffer zone prescribed in Table 1C.1.1(a).

20m

10m

f.  Notwithstanding the buffers presented in Table 1C.1.1(c) 

above, certain native vegetation that is habitat for 
species listed in the Threatened Species Conservation 
Act may require larger buffer zones in order to avoid 
potential adverse impacts on biodiversity.

Notes: 

A flora and fauna assessment may be required for development 
that involves the clearing, removal or alteration of other native 
vegetation.  A flora and fauna assessment should be prepared 
by a suitably qualified consultant and address Council’s Flora and 
Fauna Assessment Guidelines.  This may require an Assessment 
of Significance (7-part test) or Species Impact Statement.  In 
addition, a Vegetation Management Plan (VMP) may be required 
where it is likely that a proposal will impact either directly or 
indirectly on areas of remnant native bushland and/or riparian 
areas. For further information refer to:

 NSW DPI Fisheries key estuarine habitats show the spatial 
distribution of mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds

Landscaping adjacent to bushland

Note: 

g. Fencing adjoining bushland should be designed to allow 
for the movement of native fauna, and limit predation on 
native wildlife by domestic animals. The use of barb wire 
fencing is not supported.  

h. Where landscaping is proposed within the buffer zones, 

it should comprise trees, shrubs, understorey and 
groundcover species indigenous to the adjoining 
vegetation community.

Note: 

Species declared as a noxious weed in Hornsby Shire should 
not be used in landscaping works. For further information see 
the Noxious Weeds List for Hornsby Shire at website 
hornsby.nsw.gov.au.

Roadside Vegetation

i.  Native vegetation along roadsides should be retained 
where possible as it provides fauna habitat, links 
bushland areas, and maintains the scenic qualities of 
the area.

j.  Accessway crossings and utilities should be located and 
designed to minimise impacts on roadside vegetation.

Land Adjoining Public Open Space

*The term ‘fish’ includes all aquatic invertebrates such as yabbies, 
shrimps, oysters, mussels, insect larvae, beach worms, sea 
stars,and jelly fish. For key fish habitats, refer to: dpi.nsw.gov.au/
fisheries/habitat/protecting-habitats.

NSW Fisheries has gazetted the following Fish Habitat Protection 
Plans:

 Plan 1 – dealing broadly with dredging and reclamation 

activities, fish passage requirements and the protection of 
mangroves, other marine vegetation and snags.

 Plan 2 - for sea grasses,- with the aim to preserve fish 

stocks and habitats. 

 Plan 3 - for the Hawkesbury Nepean River System,- the Plan 

aims to preserve fish stocks and habitats. 

Riparian Areas

o. Development should be designed and located to 
maintain an effective watercourse riparian zone 
comprising native vegetation. See planning controls for 
watercourses at Section 1C.1.3 of this DCP.

Notes: 

The Biodiversity controls aim to implement the objectives of 
Council’s Biodiversity Conservation Strategy that includes to 
protect and improve the quality and extent of existing indigenous 
vegetation and to conserve and recreate connectivity across 
fragmented landscapes.  

k.  Development within or adjoining land zoned or reserved 
for public open space should address means to protect 
and minimise bushland disturbance.

For further information on and mapping of vegetation types 
refer to the following studies:  Native Vegetation Communities 
of Hornsby Shire (P & J Smith 2008) and Remnant Trees in the 
Southern Rural District of Hornsby Shire (P & J Smith 2008)

l.  Development should provide buffers for bushfire 
protection on private land, not on public land.

Wetlands, Salt Marsh, Seagrass Beds, Mangroves and 
Fish Habitats

m. Development proposals which may impact on fish 

habitats should have regard to gazetted Fish* Habitat 
Protection Plans.

n. Development proposals should avoid impact on key 

aquatic habitats such as saltmarsh, seagrass beds and 
mangroves as a result of their key role in the ecology of 
estuarine ecosystems.

Endangered Ecological Communities and regionally significant 
vegetation areas are mapped as Biodiversity on the HLEP 
Biodiversity Map.  Lands excluded from the Biodiversity Map 
may still contain endangered ecological communities, threatened 
species or their habitats.  

Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW) - The 
clearing or removal of any threatened flora species, endangered 
population, endangered ecological community or critical habitat 
under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 may 
require a separate approval from the NSW Office of 
Environment and Heritage.

Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 
(Commonwealth) - The clearing or removal of remnant trees or 
other native vegetation which is listed as a “matter of national 
significance” under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 1999 may require a separate approval from 
the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, 
Water, Population and Communities.

Urban Design (WSUD) Guidelines (2015) available at hornsby.nsw.
gov.au

c.  An on site stormwater management system that deals 

with detention, retention and discharge rates is required 
for all development involving external works to maintain 
environmental flow* rates in the receiving 
watercourses. 

d. An on-site detention (OSD) system, designed in 

accordance with the HSC Civil Works Specification, 
should be provided for the following types 
of development:

 Subdivision,

 Single dwellings where required by covenant, 

 Two or more dwellings, or

 Non-residential developments with external 

alterations.

e. Natural flow paths within a site and the discharge point 
from the site should be retained and directed to its 
natural catchment. 

f.  Stormwater should be gravity drained to Council’s 

drainage system, which may require inter-allotment 
drainage, except for single dwellings on existing lots 
where inter-allotment drainage is not available.

g. Where an inter allotment drainage easement is required, 
proponents should negotiate the creation of easement/s 
over downstream properties for drainage purposes. 
A letter of consent from the owner/s of the 
downstream properties is to be submitted with the 
development application.

h. On non urban properties, development should not 

prevent or significantly alter water flows to adjoining 
properties or natural ecosystems. Flows from 
impervious areas should be dispersed on-site to 
minimise erosion and impacts on adjoining properties.

Note:

*Environmental flows are the flows of water in streams and rivers 
that are necessary to maintain aquatic ecosystems.

to aquatic ecosystem protection in south east 
Australian, lowland east flowing rivers that comply in 
accordance with Australian and New Zealand Guidelines 
for Fresh and Marine Water Quality (2000).

l.  Chemical storage should be bundled and located away 
from watercourses, drainage lines or drainage pits 
which lead to the storm water system.

Notes: 

Urban areas include business, industrial, special use and 
residential zones.

Submission Requirements

m. Where development is required to address the water 
quality targets in Table 1C.1.2(b), a Water Sensitive

1C.1.3  Watercourses

Desired Outcomes

a. Watercourses such as creeks and rivers are retained 
and enhanced to promote the improvement, and 
protection of the environment.

 the effect on the catchment and existing 

development of any treatment to the watercourse, 

 the influence of previously altered sections on the 

watercourse, 

 the actual or potential influence of the watercourse 

on public health and safety, and

b. Native riparian vegetation areas are retained and 

 the mitigation of flooding and the hazard to property.

enhanced, and degraded riparian areas are rehabilitated

Riparian Areas

g. The design and location of any development should 

seek to maintain an effective riparian area and comply 
with best practice guidelines, that may require:

 A core riparian zone (CRZ) that is the land within and 
adjacent to the channel.  The width of the CRZ from 
the banks of the stream is determined by assessing 
the importance and riparian function of the 
watercourse, and

 A vegetated buffer (VB) that protects the 

environmental integrity of the CRZ, with a minimum 
width of 10 metres.

h. In addition, development should comply with any 

applicable Foreshore Building Line as prescribed by 
Clause 6.1 of the HLEP. 

i.  The riparian area should be fully vegetated with local 
native vegetation (trees, shrubs and groundcover 
species) at a density that would occur naturally. Species 
should be consistent with the existing native species 
present and Council’s Riparian Species List.

j.  A permanent physical barrier should be placed at the 

landward extent of the riparian area to prevent 
inadvertent damage to riparian vegetation where vehicle 
access to the riparian land, or mowing or slashing of 
vegetation may otherwise occur. 

k.  Any Bushfire Asset Protection Zone (APZ) should be 
measured from the asset to the outer edge of the 
vegetated buffer (VB). The APZ should contain managed 
land which should not be part of the CRZ or VB. 

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Existing natural drainage lines and water bodies on a 
site should be utilised as part of the major drainage 
network rather than piping stormwater flows.

b. All work should not cause bed and bank instability and 
any bank stabilisation measures should preferably use 
soft engineering techniques.

c.  Watercourses should be linked with other areas of 

indigenous vegetation, wildlife corridors and/or natural 
or visually important site features.

d. Stormwater outlets proposed in the vicinity of a 

watercourse should:

 point downstream for the final entry point of 

the structure,

 be graded to the bed level of the stream, or just 

below any permanent water, and

 be located to avoid existing native vegetation

e. The environmental flow characteristics of down stream 

watercourses should be maintained.

f.  Watercourses should not be piped, filled, excavated, or 
relocated. In some instances, Council will permit these 
works to occur. In determining whether to retain or 
restore a watercourse, consideration should be given to 
the following:

 the sustainability of actual or potential biodiversity 

and habitat, 

 the actual or potential ability of the watercourse to 

enhance water quality, 

 the actual or potential visual/aesthetic character of 

the watercourse, 

 the actual or potential recreational value of the 

watercourse, 

 the effect on the watercourse of the existing and 

likely future development in the catchment,

Notes:

1C.1.4  Earthworks and Slope

A watercourse includes a ‘river’ as defined in accordance with 
the Water Management Act 2000.

A riparian area is a zone of vegetation in and around the banks 
of a watercourse, lake or estuary.  This vegetation stabilises the 
banks and river bed and acts as a buffer restricting exotic species 
from entering the river. This is an essential element in retaining 
good water quality within a catchment area.

For further information refer to the NSW Department of Water 
Guidelines for Riparian Corridors on Waterfront Land available at 
www.water.nsw.gov.au.

Development within 40 metres of a watercourse may require a 
licence under the Water Management Act, 2000. 

For further information on planting in a riparian zone refer to 
Council’s Riparian Species List available at website 
hornsby.nsw.gov.au.

HLEP Clause 6.2 contains provisions for earthworks. The 
following DCP controls supplement the HLEP provisions.  

Separate DCP controls for Extractive Industries are 
provided in Section 2.5 of the DCP.

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that is designed to respect the natural 
landform characteristics and protects the stability 
of land.

b. Development that limits landform modification to 
maintain the amenity of adjoining properties and 
streetscape character.

c.  Earthworks below Mean High Water Mark (MHWM) 
that avoids, minimises and mitigates the potential for 
significant environmental harm.

Prescriptive Measures

Development Above MHWM

a. Development should be sited on the area of land 

presenting the least topographic constraints and away 
from ridge lines.  

b. Earthworks involving filling should not exceed 1 metre in 

height from the existing ground level.

c.  Excavation that extends outside of the building platform 

should be limited to a depth of 1 metre from the 
existing ground level, unless the excavation is required 
to:

 achieve a high quality built form, or

 provide for safe vehicular access to the site, and 

 it maintains the amenity of adjoining properties and 

the desired streetscape character.

d. Filling or excavation should not occur on or adjacent to, 
or have adverse impacts on sensitive environments, 
such as watercourses*, riparian land, wetlands, 
bushland, or significant vegetation.

e. Sloping sites with a gradient in excess of 20% require 
certification from a geotechnical engineer as to the 
stability of the slope in regard to the proposed design.

 the necessity to permanently remove materials from 
those rivers rather than relocating them within those 
rivers, especially for the purpose of rehabilitating 
areas of former extractive operations,

 the potential for dredging to bring to the surface 

pollutants or anoxic sediment that may result in the 
formation of acid sulphate soils,

 whether, in the circumstances, sufficient 

understanding exists of the likely impact of the works 
on the river,

 any representations made by a public authority.

h. The Statement of Environmental Effects for reclamation 

or dredging of land should contain a level of detail 
commensurate with an Environmental Impact Statement 
and demonstrate community benefit where the:

 total material volume proposed to be extracted is 

10,000 cubic metres or greater, or

 proposed earthworks operation is located within 40 

metres of the E1 National Parks and Nature Reserves 
zone, E2 Environmental Conservation zone or priority 
oyster aquaculture areas identified by the NSW 
Oyster Industry Sustainable Aquaculture Strategy.

Notes:

*Refer to Council’s Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD)
Guidelines (2015) for information on how to prepare an Erosion 
and Sediment Control Plan for developments <1500m2 .

MHWM means mean high water mark

Clause 6.2(2) of the HLEP prescribes that development consent 
is required for earthworks, unless the earthworks are exempt 
development or ancillary to development that is permitted without 
consent or development for which development consent has 
been given. Notwithstanding, pursuant to Clause 11(7) of SREP 
No.20, development consent is also required for earthworks that 
involves filling in excess of 1 metre in depth or an area of 100m2. 

Clause 6.6(3) of the HLEP provides additional matters for 
consideration when assessing proposals for earthworks.

Compaction of filled areas should be undertaken in accordance 
with relevant Australian Standards, including AS 1289 and 
AS 3798.

Earthworks Below MHWM

f.  Applications for earthworks below MHWM (i.e. dredging 
or reclamation) should submit adequate environmental 
documentation that demonstrates there is no significant 
environmental harm.

g. A Statement of Environmental Effects for the dredging 
or reclamation of land should (at a minimum) address 
impact on total catchment management, 
environmentally sensitive areas, water quality, water 
quantity, cultural heritage, flora and fauna, riverine 
scenic quality, agriculture/aquaculture and fishing, rural/
residential development, urban development, recreation 
and tourism, the Metropolitan Strategy and more 
specifically the following matters for consideration:

 the effect of extraction or reclamation on river 

dynamics, instream structures and, in particular, the 
effect on water clarity and turbidity, water velocity, 
river enlargement and light penetration,

 the desirability of maintaining river shallows to 

protect and support the aquatic habitat,

 the likely effect of extraction or reclamation on 

recreational opportunities available in the region,

 the advantages of using cutter-suction methods as 

against drag-line methods in carrying out the 
extraction,

 the likely effect of the proposed development on 
riparian and aquatic plant colonisation and, in 
particular, the desirability of:

- confining extractive or reclamation operations to 
small sections of the waterways which do not 
contain those colonies, and

- not permitting extractive or reclamation operations 

in large sections of those rivers, and

- re-establishing riparian and aquatic plants if 

destroyed by the development,

 the need to protect fish breeding grounds, 

commercial and recreational fishing areas and 
oyster farming,

 whether the proposed development is appropriate to 
mitigate the problem necessitating the development 
without creating a similar problem elsewhere in 
the river,

 any alternative means of undertaking the works which 
would reduce the need for extraction or reclamation,

1-36

1C.2 Built Environment 

The following section provides general controls for the 
protection of the built environment and applies to all forms 
of development.  

 there is poor sight distance from the driveway to 

pedestrian or vehicular traffic,

 the accessway fronts a main road or highly 

pedestrianised area, or 

 where vehicles would otherwise have to reverse 

1C.2.1  Transport and Parking

Table 5.1 (page 5-3) 

o. Car parking should be provided on site in accordance 

with the minimum parking rates in Tables 1C.2.1(c) and 
1C.2.1(d). Parking spaces are for cars, unless otherwise 
specified.  The minimum parking rates in Tables 
1C.2.1(d) should apply for development within Epping 
Town Centre Core.  Where the land use is not specified 
in Table 1C.2.1(d), the relevant rate in Table 1C.2.1(c) will 
apply. 

p. The parking rate for sites located within the Epping 
Town Centre Core referred to in Table 1C.2.1(d) and 
paragraphs 1C.2.1(y)-(ak) refers to residential, 
educational and business development sites that fall 
within those areas identified as “Town Centre Core” on 
Figure 4.6(a) in Part 4 - Business.  Where a development 
site falls partly within the Epping Town Centre Core, the 
parking rate for the Town Centre Core is to apply to the 
whole development.

q. The car parking rate for sites less than (<) 800 metres 
from a railway station in Table 1C.2.1(c) is a radial 
distance from the main pedestrian entry.  Where a 
development site falls partly within the 800 metre 
radius, the parking rate for “sites <800m” is to apply to 
the whole development.

r.  A Car Parking Demand Assessment should be provided 

for:

 any significant variation proposed to the minimum 

parking rates prescribed in Table 1C.2.1(c) or 
1C.2.1(d), 

 land uses not specified in Table 1C.2.1(c) or 1C.2.1(d), 

or

 intensive traffic generating developments.

s.  Before granting approval to depart from on-site parking 
rates specified in Tables 1C.2.1(c) or 1C.2.1(d), Council 
will consider the Car Parking Demand Assessment and 
any other relevant planning consideration.

t.  A Car Parking Demand Assessment should address at 

minimum the following matters:

 any relevant parking policy,

 the availability of alternative car parking in the locality 

of the land, including:

 -  efficiencies gained from the consolidation of shared 

car parking spaces on the same site,

-   public car parks intended to serve the land,

-   extent of existing on-street parking in non residential 

zones,

b. Noise sensitive landuses should include siting and 

design measures to ameliorate the potential impact 
of existing noise generating uses on the 
proposed development.

c.  Noise sensitive landuses adjoining a major road or a 

railway corridor should be accompanied by an acoustic 
report that demonstrates the site and building design is 
suitable for use in terms of acoustic amenity.

d. High, solid acoustic fences should be avoided forward 

of the building line other than for noise sensitive 
landuses along major roads that are exposed to 
significant noise. In these instances, fences should be a 
maximum height of 1.8 metres and incorporate 
articulation. Large unbroken sections of fencing should 
be avoided.

Notes: 

Noise sensitive landuses include dwellings or approved 
residential building envelopes on vacant lots, a place of public 
worship, a hospital, an educational establishment, a child care

Avoiding Isolated Sites

1C.3 Hazards

Desired Outcomes

a. The consolidation of sites in a manner that avoids 

adjoining sites becoming isolated so that they cannot be 
developed in accordance with the planning controls. 

The following section provides general controls for hazards 
and applies to all forms of development.

1C.3.1  Bushfire

Desired Outcomes

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development that is located and designed to minimise 

a. The creation of isolated sites is not desirable.

the risk to life and property from bushfires.

b. Where a development may result in the creation of an 
isolated site, the applicant should demonstrate that:

b. Development that balances the conservation of native 

vegetation and bushfire protection.  

 Negotiations for amalgamations of sites commenced 

early, prior to the lodgement of a development 
application,

 If negotiations are not successful, details of the 

negotiations should be provided with the 
development application submission, including at 
least one recent independent valuation (which 
considers the property as being part of a complying 
amalgamated site) and include other reasonable 
expenses likely to be incurred by the owner of the 
isolated property in the sale of the property, and

 The orderly and economic development of the 

isolated site can be achieved that is consistent with 
the provisions of the HLEP and DCP.  This should 
include the applicant providing an envelope for that 
site, indicating height, building form, setbacks and 
separations (building and basement) sufficient to 
understand the relationship between the proposed 
development and the isolated site and the 
streetscape implications.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development on land identified as bushfire prone on 

Council’s Bushfire Prone Land Map should address the 
bush fire protection measures in the publication 
Planning for Bushfire Protection (2006).

b. Development should be located and designed to 

minimise the need for bushfire hazard reduction within 
native vegetation areas.

c.  Bushfire Asset Protection Zones should be located 

entirely within the development site.

d. Measures such as higher fire resistant construction 

standards, improved access and water supplies should 
be considered for infill developments where they would 
reduce the need for removal of significant native 
vegetation, provided the development still complies 
with Planning for Bushfire Protection (2006). 

Notes:

c.  The development of an isolated site should not detract 

from the character of the streetscape and is to achieve a 
satisfactory level of amenity, including solar access, 
visual and acoustic privacy.

The key objectives and controls to address bushfire risk are not 
set out in this Plan but are incorporated into the Rural Fire Service 
publication entitled ‘Planning for Bushfire Protection 2006 (PBP) 
(as amended), as well as the Rural Fires Act 1997 available at 
www.bushfire.nsw.gov.au.

Notes:

An Isolated Site means a site whose size and location could 
potentially significantly limit development as a result of not 
being included in an adjoining development proposal.  Sites may 
not be defined as isolated if they have the future potential to 
amalgamate with an alternate adjoining property. 

For further information on the Planning Principles for considering 
the isolation of sites refer to Karavellas v Sutherland Shire Council 
[2004] NSWLEC 251 at www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au.

All development applications on bushfire prone land will 
require either:

 A bushfire risk assessment and certification or

 A detailed bushfire report (for integrated development)

1-60

A Bushfire Risk Assessment and Certification are prepared for 
non-integrated developments such as single dwelling houses.  
The report and certification will state the applicable Bushfire 
Attack Levels (BAL) that apply and the relevant Asset Protection 
Zones (APZ) required, and that the development conforms to the 
relevant specifications and requirements, AS 3959 and Planning 
for Bushfire Protection 2006. Council or a suitably qualified 
consultant can provide this assessment.  

A Detailed Bushfire Report is required to be provided for 
Integrated Development under the Rural Fires Act, including for 
example the subdivision of land. The report must be prepared 
by a suitably qualified bushfire consultant and address the 
requirements of the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) and Planning 
for Bushfire Protection 2006. The Council will refer this plan to the 
RFS for its consideration. 

1C.3.2  Flooding

HLEP Clause 6.3 contains provisions for development of 
land at or below the flood planning level. Areas identified 
as ‘Flood Planning areas’ are identified in the HLEP Flood 
Planning Map.

any development application on land that demonstrates 
that: 

 The development addresses the provisions of Clause 

6.3 of the HLEP, and

 The development complies with best practice.

b. The overland flow path should not be built upon and 

should have minimal planting. Development is required 
to demonstrate that any overland flow is maintained for 
1 in 100 year average recurrence interval (ARI) flood.

c.  All potential pollutants that are stored or detained 

on-site (such as on-site effluent treatment facilities, 
chemicals or hazardous materials) should be stored 0.5 
metres above 1 in 100 year ARI flood level. Details 
should be provided as part of any application.

Sea Level Rise

d. Development on land adjacent to tidal waters, including 
the Hawkesbury River and Berowra Creek, should be 
designed to minimise the risk to property and the 
environment from sea level rise in the event of a 1 in 
100 year ARI flood by:

 siting the floor level of habitable rooms, wet areas 
and other sensitive uses (eg. on-site wastewater 
disposal areas) above the 2100 (year) NSW sea level 
rise planning benchmark of 0.9 metres, and

 siting other non-habitable structures (eg. sheds, 

decks, pergolas) above the 2050 (year) NSW sea level 

rise planning benchmark of 0.4 metres.

Soils Manual.

Notes:

For further information refer to the HLEP and the Acid Sulfate 
Soils Map.  

The Acid Sulfate Soils Manual means the manual by that 
name published by the Acid Sulfate Soils Management Advisory 
Committee and made publicly available.

A preliminary investigation of the proposed development site or 
an acid sulfate soils management plan required by the HLEP must 
be prepared by a suitably qualified environmental consultant.

* Clause 6.3 of the HLEP refers to the 1 in 100 year Average 
Recurrence Interval (ARI) flood event for flood planning purposes. 
ARI is the long term average number of years between the 
occurrence of a flood as big as or larger than the selected event. 
This flood event is a tool for broadly assessing the suitability 
of land for development. It does not mean that properties and 
development above the flood planning level are not subject to 
flood risk.

* While some of the land in the Hornsby Shire that is at or below 
the flood planning level is depicted on the HLEP Flood Planning 
Map - flood planning area’, this map is not exhaustive. A Section 
149 Planning Certificate will identify whether or not the land is 
subject to exposure to tidal inundation and/or flood hazard risk.

* The NSW Sea Level Rise Policy Statement (2009) adopts a sea 
level rise planning benchmark of an increase above 1990 mean 
sea levels of 90cm by 2100 or 0.4m by 2050.

The CSIRO on behalf of the Sydney Coastal Council Group (SCCG) 
has undertaken modelling of coastal inundation under future sea 
levels. They have released sea level rise maps for Hornsby Shire 
that will help residents understand the impact of predicted sea 
levels. The maps can be accessed online at:

1C.3.4  Land Contamination

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that remediates contaminated land for the 
purpose of reducing the risk of harm to human health 
and the environment

Prescriptive Measures

a. Developments applications should prepare and submit a 
preliminary contamination assessment in accordance 
with SEPP 55 Remediation of Land where land is 
suspected to be contaminated, and:

 The application proposes a change of use to a 

sensitive land use such as residential, educational, 
recreational, child care purposes, or for the purposes 
of a hospital land, or

 Work is proposed that may disturb contaminated land 

(for example, earthworks at a petrol station).

b. Where a preliminary assessment identifies that a 
contaminant is present on the site, a detailed 
investigation of the site should also be prepared and 
lodged with the development application.

c.  A remedial action plan, validation report and a site audit 

statement may also be required to be completed.

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to land within the Rural area 
of Hornsby Shire. The Rural areas extend from Glenhaven 
and Dural in the south to Wisemans Ferry in the North, as 
indicated in Figure 2(a).

The planning controls for the rural area are informed by the 
Rural Lands Study (1995), the Rural Resource Lands Study 
(2006)  and the Hornsby Shire Rural Lands Planning 
Provisions Review (2009).

Development in rural areas will be environmentally 
sustainable and protect and improve water quaIity, native 
flora and fauna, soil, air and other environmental values. 
Development will also protect and enhance the visual 
qualities and characteristics of the rural environment by 
being compatible with the scale, form, design, colour, 
height, materials, setbacks and landscaping of the 
surrounding rural area.

Rural uses will be protected and promoted in Hornsby 
Shire as they are important for the local and regional 
economy. Existing or potentially productive agricultural land 
will be protected from fragmentation and sterilisation by 
competing land uses as agricultural production provides an 
important source of food supply and natural resources for 
the Sydney Basin. Natural and man made tourism and 
tourist infrastructure important for the economy will also 
be protected from the encroachment of urban and rural 
residential development.

b. The above setback controls also apply to structures, 

including crop netting and green houses.

Notes: 

Designated roads

Designated roads are Council identified roads that require 
development to have an increased setback from the road edge, 
consistent with the established streetscape. A list of designated 
roads is provided in Annexure C.

An intensive rural activity includes intensive agriculture, garden 
centres, plant nurseries and landscaping material supplies, animal 
boarding or training establishments, rural industries, extractive 
industries and the like.

Sensitive land uses include dwellings or approved building 
envelopes on vacant lots, tourist accommodation, community 
uses, educational uses, public open space, and sheds or premises 
used for the manufacture, preparation, sale or storage of food.

Sites with more than one frontage

c.  For buildings with a corner frontage: 

 front and rear boundary setbacks apply to the shorter 

street frontage (the primary frontage), and 

 side boundary setbacks apply to the longer of the 
two street frontages (the secondary boundary).

d. For a lot that adjoins parallel roads, the front boundary 

setback control applies to both the primary frontage and 
the parallel road boundary. 

Setbacks to Landscape Features

e. The setback of buildings from the property boundary 
may need to be increased to maintain landscape 
features, as detailed in Section 2.1.3 of this DCP.

2-8

2.1.3 Landscaping

Desired Outcomes

a. Landscaping that integrates the built form with the 

locality and enhances the tree canopy.

b. Landscaping that retains existing landscape features. 

Fences and Gates

f.  Frontages/ streetscapes should not contain excessively 
urban features such as formal gates and high fences.  

g. Fences should be open style and constructed of 
materials such as timber or post and wire, with a 
maximum height of 1.8 metres. 

c.  Landscaping that is consistent with the visual 

landscapes in the rural area.

h. Any masonry gate entry feature should not extend more 

than 3 metres either side of the driveway entrance.

i.  High, solid fences constructed as sound barriers should 
be avoided.  On main roads alternative measures of 
reducing traffic noise should be explored, such as 
double glazing, internal layout, earth mounds and 
vegetation, rather than high solid fences. 

Figure 2.1(a) Example of a suitable open style rural fence. (E)

Figure 2.1(b) Example of a masonry entry feature that does

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Landscaping should maintain the natural features, 

topography and vegetation on the site.

b. Setback areas should be landscaped.

c.  Vehicle crossings should be located to preserve natural 
vegetation which contributes to the visual amenity of 
the area.

d. Intensive rural activities, should provide a landscape 

buffer to boundaries with a minimum width of 5 metres.  

Retention of Landscape Features

e. Buildings, driveways and service trenches should have a 

minimum setback:

 in accordance with the ‘Watercourses’ element in 

Section 1C.1.3 of this DCP,

 10 to 20 metres to significant bushland as prescribed 
in the ‘Biodiversity’ element in Section 1C.1.1 of this 
DCP, and

 in accordance with the requirements of AS4970 from 

significant trees to be retained.

Notes:  

An intensive rural activity includes intensive agriculture, garden 
centres, plant nurseries and landscaping material supplies, animal 
boarding or training establishments, rural industries, extractive 
industries and the like.

A Landscape buffer is to include screen planting, preferably 
including vegetation that is endemic to the area.  Alternatively, fire 
retardant species should be considered in bushfire prone areas. 

The applicant is encouraged to incorporate species from Council’s 
publication Indigenous Plants for the Bushland Shire available on 
Council’s website hornsby.nsw.gov.au.

Main roads

Development adjoining roads that are subject to Clause 101 (2a) 
of the Infrastructure State Environmental Planning Policy 2007 
require separate approval from the RMS for access to State and 
Regional Roads as classified by the Roads and Maritime Services 
(RMS). A list of classified and unclassified main roads for Hornsby 
Shire as of September 2016 is provided in Annexure C.

2.2 Rural Land Uses

The following section provides controls for rural landuses, 
in addition to the building controls provided elsewhere in 
this DCP. 

2.2.1 Intensive Plant Agriculture

Desired Outcome

a. Intensive plant agriculture establishments that are 

appropriately separated from adjoining sensitive land 
uses to minimise visual impacts and land use conflicts.

b. Development for intensive plant agriculture that does 

not result in significant landform modification.

20m

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Site planning should provide adequate area for:

Notes:  

Intensive plant agriculture means any of the following: 

(a)  the cultivation of irrigated crops for commercial purposes 
(other than irrigated pasture or fodder crops), 

 landscaping buffers, 

 dams and/or water tanks, 

 waste water treatment, 

 water quality treatment, 

 driveways and parking areas, and

 dwelling houses and ancillary facilities.

(b)  horticulture,

(c)  turf farming, 

(d)  viticulture.

Sensitive land uses include dwellings or approved building 
envelopes on vacant lots, tourist accommodation, community 
uses, educational uses, public open space, and sheds or premises 
used for the manufacture, preparation, sale or storage of food.

b. Any portion of a site with a slope greater than 10% 
should not be used for intensive plant agriculture.

Vegetation buffers should provide significant foliage and grow 
to a height to screen structures. In bushfire prone areas, fire 
retardant species should be utilised. 

Landuse Separation

c.  Intensive plant agriculture should be sited to limit the 

potential for landuse conflicts with neighbouring 
sensitive land uses.  

d. Structures should be screened by the use of crops or 

landscape buffers.

e. The distance between intensive plant agriculture and an 

adjoining dwelling house should conform to the 
minimum requirements in Table 2.2.1(a).

For further information refer to Prime Fact 1139 Assessing 
Intensive Plant Agriculture Developments (Dec 2011) by the 
Department of Primary Industries available on 
www.dpi.nsw.gov.au.

The minimum separations prescribed in Table 2.2.1(a) aim to 
minimise rather than eliminate impacts from rural activities.  
Larger separations between intensive plant agriculture and 
sensitive uses at a zone interface would be appropriate to ensure 
all impacts are internalised.

2-12

2.2.2 Water Storage Facilities (Dams)

Desired Outcomes

a. Water storage facilities that are constructed and sited to 

be stable and have minimal environmental impact.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Dams should not prevent or significantly alter water 
flows to adjoining properties or natural ecosystems.

b. Dams should not be located on sites with a gradient in 

excess of 15%.

c.  Dam design guidelines are illustrated in Figure 2.2(a).  
The dam spillway should be designed for the 1 in 20 
year storm event.

d. Development applications for a dam that has a 

maximum capacity greater than 0.4 megalitres or for an 
additional dam that results in the total capacity of all 
dams on the property exceeding 1 megalitre should be 
accompanied by a report from a suitably qualified 
hydraulic services consultant, assessing the impact 
that the proposed dam will have on downstream flows 
and environments.

e. Water quality management measures should be 

incorporated with the dam, such as vegetation on the 
perimeter of the dam and within the dam to reduce the 
occurrence of problematic algae.

Notes: 

Water storage facility means 
a dam, weir or reservoir for 
the collection and storage of 
water, and includes associated 
monitoring or gauging equipment.

A licence from the Office of 
Water is required for certain 
categories of dams. Please refer 
to the Office’s website 
www.water.nsw.gov.au and 
information sheet titled 
Farm Dams – do you need a 
licence for further information.

2.2.4 Animal Boarding or Training 

Establishments

Desired Outcomes

a. Animal boarding or training establishments that are 
sympathetic to the rural character of the area and 
have minimal impact on the amenity of surrounding 
land uses. 

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Animal boarding and training establishments (including 

exercising areas) should be sited and designed to 
minimise noise and odour impacts on adjoining land.

b. Applications should be accompanied with a 

management plan addressing sustainable stocking rates 
that take 
into account pasture quality, hand feeding, and 
land degradation.

Landuse Separation

c.  Animal accommodation (such as stables, kennels, 

exercise areas, aviaries, pens and the like) should be 
separated from sensitive land uses at least in 
accordance with Table 2.2.4(a). 

Table 2.2.4(a): Minimum separation between animal 
boarding and training establishment and sensitive land uses

 The likely generation of offensive odours.  An odour 
modelling assessment should be provided that may 
require an increase in landuse separation to sensitive 
land uses.

e. Noise from barking dogs should be limited by design 

techniques such as:

 siting kennels so that they do not face each other, 

 limiting external stimulation, e.g. by partitioning 

between kennels or using blinds, 

 provide screening between the dogs and 

neighbouring properties and the public domain in 
order to avoid distracting the animals, (eg. by children 
playing, vehicles entering and leaving a property), and

 holding dogs singly or in compatible pairs.

Notes: 

An animal boarding or training establishment means a 
building or place used for the breeding, boarding, training, 
keeping or caring of animals for commercial purposes (other than 
for the agistment of horses), and includes any associated riding 
school or ancillary veterinary hospital

Sensitive land uses include dwellings or approved building 
envelopes on vacant lots, tourist facilities, community uses, 
educational uses, public open space, and sheds or premises used 
for the manufacture, preparation, sale or storage of food.

 sites greater than 4000m2,

 reduced exposure to neighbouring dwellings and 

noise sensitive areas, 

 the intensity, size and scale of the industry,

 sites with good vehicular access, parking, and 

loading/unloading facilities,

 ability to visually screen the development, and

 an appropriate area for expansion.

b. Rural industries should be sited and designed to 

minimise noise, odour and visual impacts on adjoining 
land uses and include measures such as:

 landscaped buffers,

 odour management,

 sound attenuation, such as earth mounds, fencing 

and insulation of machinery.

Note:  

A rural industry means the handling, treating, production, 
processing, storage or packing of animal or plant agricultural 
products for commercial purposes, and includes any of the 
following:

(a) agricultural produce industries,

(b) livestock processing industries,

(c) composting facilities and works (including the production of 
mushroom substrate),

 have a maximum gross floor area of 110m2,, or

 involve the conversion of an existing dwelling. 

b. Rural workers’ dwellings should only be constructed 
where rural undertakings on the property have the 
capacity to support both the primary producer and the 
rural worker.

c.  Rural workers’ dwellings should be located not to affect 

the capability of land to be used for agriculture.

d. All applications for rural workers dwellings should be 
accompanied by advice from a qualified agricultural 
consultant or financial documentation certifying that the 
agricultural activity on the allotment justifies the 
demand for a rural workers dwelling.

e. Development applications for a rural workers’ dwellings 

should be accompanied by:

(a) a site plan showing the nature and extent of 
agricultural undertakings on the land;

(b) a detailed description of the agricultural 
undertakings on the land which should include:

 the calculated area of the site used for each 

agricultural activity, 

 the rural workers’ hours of employment, and

 the number of people employed, and on what basis 

(e.g. full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal).

(c) gross margin budgets or accounts which 
demonstrate the ability of the established enterprises 
to support both the farmer and the rural worker.

f.  A rural workers dwelling cannot be erected on a 
separate lot created for the purposes of primary 
production pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the HLEP.

Note:

A rural worker’s dwelling means a building or place that is 
additional to a dwelling house on the same lot and that is used 
predominantly as a place of residence by persons employed, 
whether on a long-term or short-term basis, for the purpose of 
agriculture or a rural industry on that land.

2.2.7 Secondary Dwelling

Notes:

HLEP Clause 5.4 contains provisions for development of 
Secondary Dwellings. The following controls apply to land 
zoned RU1 Primary Production, RU2 Rural Landscape, RU4 
Small Lot Primary Production, and RU5 Village.

A secondary dwelling means a self-contained dwelling that:

(a) is established in conjunction with another dwelling (the 
principal dwelling), and

(b) is on the same lot of land as the principal dwelling, and

Desired Outcomes

a. Secondary dwellings that provide opportunity for an 

extension of family accommodation or affordable rental 
accommodation in the rural area and maintain the rural 
character of the area.

Prescriptive Measures

a. A secondary dwelling should:

 have a maximum total floor area of 60m2, or

 33% of the total floor area of the principal dwelling, 

whichever is the greater.

(c) is located within, or is attached to, or is separate from, the 
principal dwelling.

Total Floor Area means gross floor area as defined by the HLEP.

Case Study Example:

Mike and Lisa own a 2 hectare block of land zoned RU4 and have 
developed a 500m2 principal dwelling on the site (excluding the 
garage). The property can therefore accommodate a secondary 
dwelling with a gross floor area of up to 165m2 (33% of 500m2).  

In determining where and how the secondary dwelling should 
be accommodated, they now need to consider the provisions of 
2.2.7 of the DCP and other applicable controls, (eg. Part 1 and 
Section 2.1 of the DCP) that includes controls such as:

b. Secondary dwellings should not be attached to farm 

 Scale (height, roof design, design details)

buildings or rural buildings.

 Setbacks (including separation to intensive rural activities)

 Private Open Space,

 Car parking,

 Biodiversity,

 Bushfire,

 Landscaping,

 Effluent Disposal, and

 Building Sustainability (BASIX)

c.  Secondary dwellings should be located not to affect the 

capability of land to be used for agriculture.

d. Vehicular access to both dwellings should be from a 

single common driveway or access from the public road.

e. Where the creation of a secondary dwelling involves an 
extension to an existing dwelling house, the secondary 
dwelling should be constructed of the same materials of 
the existing dwelling, or the existing dwelling should be 
renovated to match the proposed external materials of 
the new dwelling.

f.  Where the primary and secondary dwelling are attached 
on land zoned RU1, RU2 and RU4, the total length of 
the front elevation should not exceed 50% of the 
frontage of the lot.

g. Subdivision of land to provide a separate lot for an 

approved  secondary dwelling is not supported if the 
resultant lots are smaller than the applicable minimum 
lot size shown on the HLEP Lot Size Map, pursuant to 
Clause 2.6 of the HLEP.

h. A secondary dwelling can not be erected on a separate 

lot created for the purposes of primary production 
pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the HLEP.

2.2.8 Tourist and Visitor Accommodation 

Short-Term Rental Accommodation

These controls apply to Bed and Breakfast 
Accommodation, Farm Stay Accommodation and 
Short-Term Rental Accommodation (comprising short-term 
holiday letting of a dwelling).

Desired Outcomes

a. Tourist and visitor accommodation that is compatible in 
scale and character with development in the locality.

b. Tourist and visitor accommodation that provides 

adequate facilities and services for occupants and are 
located and designed to minimise amenity impacts on 
the locality.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. A single sign should be displayed in public view within 

the property boundaries that:

 has a maximum area of 0.5m2,

f.  Short-term rental accommodation should:

 be undertaken in a lawful dwelling, 

 be on a short-term basis (less than 90 days), and

 comprise a maximum of 6 guests.

g. A Code of Conduct to be signed and adhered to by 
guests should be prepared and submitted with the 
development application.  The Code of Conduct should, 
at a minimum, address the following responsibilities of 
guests during their stay:

 maximum guest numbers, 

 contact number of the property manager including an 

after hours number, 

 noise and lighting restrictions for activities between 

10pm and 8am, 

 instructions concerning recycling, garbage services 
and special requirements relating to the disposal of 
garbage, and

 includes details of the land use, name(s) of the 

 procedures in case of an emergency.

owner/establishment and 24 hour contact phone 
number, and 

Notes:

 should not be illuminated.

b. In unsewered areas, it should be demonstrated that the 
existing sewage management system is adequate for 
the proposed use or will be upgraded. 

c.  Active recreation facilities, such as barbeque areas, 
should be located away from the bedroom areas of 
adjoining dwellings.

d. If relevant, a bushfire evacuation plan should be 

submitted with the development application showing 
means of evacuation in an emergency.  The bushfire 
evacuation plan should be displayed within the dwelling 
or sleeping rooms.

Bed and Breakfast Accommodation and Farm Stay 
Accommodation

e. Bed and breakfast accommodation and farm stay 

accommodation should:

 be undertaken by the permanent residents of the 

dwelling-house, and

 be on a short-term basis, and

 comprise a maximum maximum of 3 bedrooms 

catering for a maximum of 6 guests. 

The change of use of a dwelling to tourist and visitor 
accommodation may require a change of classification under the 
Building Code of Australia (BCA).  This may require significant fire 
upgrading work and disabled access provision to the building.

Bed and breakfast accommodation means an existing dwelling 
in which temporary or short-term accommodation is provided on 
a commercial basis by the permanent residents of the dwelling 
and where:

(a) meals are provided for guests only, and 

(b) cooking facilities for the preparation of meals are not provided 
within guests’ rooms, and 

(c) dormitory-style accommodation is not provided.

Farm stay accommodation means a building or place that 
provides temporary or short-term accommodation to paying 
guests on a working farm as a secondary business to primary 
production.

Short-term rental accommodation differs from bed and 
breakfast accommodation in that visitors of the latter are hosted 
by the permanent residents of the dwelling where the former has 
no on-site manager.  It is otherwise known as short-term holiday 
letting.  So called “party houses” conflict with residential amenity, 
damaging to the Holiday Rental industry and are not permitted.

For further information on preparing a Holiday Rental Code 
of Conduct, refer to the best practice publication Holiday 
Rental Code of Conduct - Version 1 (March 2012) available at 
destinationnsw.com.au.

2.2.9 Attached Dual Occupancy

The following controls apply to the development of 
Attached Dual Occupancies on land zoned RU1 Primary 
Production, RU2 Rural Landscape and RU4 Small Lot 
Primary Production.

Desired Outcomes

a. Attached dual occupancies that provide opportunity for 
an extension of family accommodation or affordable 
rental accommodation in the rural area and maintain the 
rural character of the area.

Prescriptive Measures

f.  Vehicular access to both dwellings should be from a 

single common driveway or access from the public road.

g. Where the creation of an attached dual occupancy 

involves an extension to an existing dwelling house, the 
new dwelling should be constructed of the same 
materials of the existing dwelling, or the existing 
dwelling should be renovated to match the proposed 
external materials of the new dwelling.

h. Subdivision of land pursuant to provide a separate lot for 
an approved attached dual occupancy is not supported if 
the resultant lots are smaller than the applicable 
minimum lot size shown on the HLEP Lot Size Map. 
pursuant to Clauses 4.1, 4.1AA and 4.1A of the HLEP.

a. An attached dual occupancy should be on land with a lot 

size equal to or greater than than the applicable 
minimum lot size shown on the HLEP Lot Size Map, 
pursuant to Clause 6.9 of the HLEP.

i.  An attached dual occupancy cannot be erected on a 
separate lot created for the purposes of primary 
production pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the HLEP.

b. One of the dwellings that forms an attached dual 

Notes:

occupancy should not have a total floor area that is 
greater than 200m2, pursuant to Clause 6.9 of the HLEP.

c.  An attached dual occupancy should either be attached 

by a common wall or the main roof and have the general 
appearance of a single dwelling house when viewed 
from the primary street frontage. Mirror reversed dual 
occupancies or replica dwelling designs are not 
supported.

d. Where attached dual occupancies front a public road, 

the total length of the front elevation should not exceed 
50% of the frontage of the lot.

e. Where the roof is shared, the closest walls of the 
dwelling should not be more than 6 metres apart. 
Structures such as carports, pergoals or covered 
walkways are not acceptable means of attaching the 
two dwellings.

Attached dual occupancy or Dual occupancy (attached) means 
2 dwellings on one lot of land that are attached to each other, but 
does not include a secondary dwelling.

Total Floor Area means gross floor area as defined by the HLEP.

Case Study Examples:

John and Mary own a 2.5 hectare block of RU2 zoned land and 
have a 500m2 existing dwelling on the site (excluding the garage). 
They propose to attach a second dwelling to the existing dwelling. 
The property can therefore accommodate and attached dual 
occupancy with a gross floor area of up to 200m, pursuant to 
Clause 6.9 of the HLEP.

In determining where and how the second dwelling should be 
accommodated, they now need to consider the provisions of 
2.2.9 of the HDCP and other applicable controls (eg. Part 1 and 
Section 2.1 of the DCP) that includes controls such as:

 Scale (height, roof design, design details);

 Setbacks (including separation to intensive rural activities);

 Private Open Space;

 Car Parking;

 Biodiversity;

 Bushfire;

 Landscaping;

 Effluent Disposal; and

 Building Sustainability (BASIX).

Figure 2.2(b): Covered walkways are not acceptable means of 
attaching the two dwellings. (E)

agencies including NSW Office of Water and the EPA, 

 recommendations to alter operational procedures to 
improve the performance of artificial and natural 
surface and subsurface water cycles, and

 applications should include a determination of the 
likely impact upon groundwater and nominate an 
effective freeboard above the high groundwater level 
capable of protecting groundwater flow patterns and 
water quality on each extraction site.

 Based on the above factors, the report should idenitfy 
any adverse environmental impacts in accordance 
with the Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for 
Fresh and Marine Water Quality (ANZECC Guidelines, 
2000), and outline any mitigation measures.

2.5.4 Soil And Water Management

Desired Outcome

i.  Topsoil stripping should not be undertaken when soil is 

too wet or too dry to avoid compaction, loss of structure 
and viability of seeds.

Runoff Controls

j.  Surface runoff from undisturbed areas should be 

diverted around proposed extraction/operation areas and 
returned to natural watercourses at non-erosive 
velocities. All channels should be designed to convey 
water at velocities less than 1.2m/s for vegetated 
channels and 0.4m/s for bare earth channels.

k.  All channels, waterways and detention structures should 
be designed to accommodate peak discharge of a 1 in 
20 year average recurrence interval storm with 
appropriate freeboard margins (generally 750mm for 
catchments less than 15 hectares).

l.  The long term stability of natural channels downstream 
of the study area should be maintained by ensuring that 
discharges from subcatchments remain the same.

m. Overland flow paths and spillways should be designed 
to ensure that flood waters and stormwater runoff, 
which exceeds the design capacity of channels, 
watercourses and structures, do not adversely affect 
adjoining lands.

Water Quality

n. Water quality at the downstream boundary of each 
development area will be required to be monitored 
monthly by the proponent. A report, including the results 
of the water sampling will be required to be prepared by 
a suitably qualified environmental consultant and 
submitted to Council annually. Should the results of the 
water sampling identify elevated levels compared with 
the ANZECC Guidelines 2000, the report must outline the 
mitigation measures undertaken at the development area 
to maintain water quality. 

a. Extractive operations that minimise soil erosion and 
water pollution by minimising land disturbance, and 
requiring control measures on-site.

Prescriptive Measures

Clearing

a. Vegetation should only be removed in stages to retain 

as much protective ground cover vegetation as possible.

b. The natural vegetation outside the extraction site should 

be protected at all times by the installation and 
maintenance of sediment control devices.

c.  Progressive clearing should be restricted to within the 

approved boundaries of the extraction area.

Topsoil and overburden removal

d. Topsoil and overburden stripping should not advance any 
more than 30 metres in front of the current extraction 
operation.

e. Stockpiles should be located in low erosion hazard areas 
away from drainage lines and stabilised by vegetation 
and the use of silt fences.

f.  Removed topsoil should be used for rehabilitation of 
previously disturbed areas in order to maintain the 
freshness of the topsoil. Topsoil removal should occur in 
two stages, organic matter and then the topsoil.

g. Where material is to be stored in stockpiles, the 

stockpile should be:

 of one soil type;

 kept flat and low to ensure survival of organic matter 

and aerobic organisms;

 keep free of traffic and drainage lines;

 not left for more than 14 days without a vegetation 

cover;

 surrounded by sediment control devices, and

 used as soon as possible (no longer than 12 months).

h. Stockpiles over 5 metres in height should be benched to 

ensure stability and incorporate internal drains. The 
batter slopes should be no steeper than 1:2 (v:h) for 
stable soils and 1:4(v:h) for highly erodible soils, to limit 
wind and water erosion.

Sediment Control Devices

level, and insitu materials, 

o. Wind breaks including vegetation, bund walls and 
stockpiles should be of sufficient height, length, 
orientation, location and permeability to be capable of 
reducing wind velocity across extraction areas.

p. Appropriate sediment control devices should be 

installed to prevent sediment moving off-site (these can 
include sediment fences, straw bales, sediment traps 
and sediment basins).Existing rural dams should be 
retained to serve as sediment basins and to reduce 
runoff during development.

 site suitability, including topography, geotechnical and 

meteorological conditions of the locality, 

 physical, mineral and chemical properties of tailings, 

 stability of embankments, including height, slope, 

nature strength, materials and degree of compaction 
of foundations, 

 potential seepage into groundwater, including high 
pressure groundwater levels resulting from high 
water table levels within the embankment, and

q. All sediment and control dams should be sized to retain 
at least the equivalent volume of 10mm depth of runoff 
over the entire disturbed area they serve. The settling 
volume is to be provided as active storage with a 
minimum depth of 0.6 metres. A sediment storage 
volume of at least half this allowance is to be provided 
below the settling volume.

r.  The design of the sediment control dam should include 
details of the proposed dewatering method for the 
settling volume, spillway configuration and the design 
life of the structure.

s.  All water retaining structures should incorporate an 

impermeable barrier in the dam wall.

t.  A sediment control dam should be located downstream 

of wet screening plants and the tailing dams. The 
structure is to have a sediment trapping capacity of at 
least half the volume of the largest tailing dam.

u. Batters of dams and detention basins should have a 

maximum gradient of 1 (vertical) in 4 (horizontal) and be 
vegetated immediately following construction. Prior to 
the establishment of this vegetative cover, sediment 
loss is to be controlled by the installation of catch 
drains and sediment traps along the downstream toe of 
the embankment. These should be maintained until 
such time as 80% vegetation cover is achieved on 
the batters.

v.  Sedimentation dams associated with sediment control 
structures will require periodic removal of sediment. 
This material should be dried and utilised on landfill in 
rehabilitated landforms.

 potential seepage through embankments to 

surface water streams or overtopping from heavy 
storm events.

x. Tailing ponds should be rehabilitated having regard to:

 preventing leaching into ground and surface waters, 

 surface drainage and erosion control to prevent tailing 

laden waters leaving storage area, 

 stabilised surface cover to prevent wind erosion, and

 minimise maintenance by designing a cover which 
provides an effective infiltration rate that prevents 
surface erosion, saturation of topsoil layer and to 
function as a capillary barrier.

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to residential development 
within the Residential zones of the Hornsby Local 
Government Area.  

The planning controls for the low density residential areas 
are informed by the NSW Housing Code, while the 
planning controls for the medium and high density 
residential areas are informed by the Hornsby Shire 
Housing Strategy (2010) and the State Government’s Urban 
Activation Precinct Program.

The Hornsby Shire Housing Strategy and the State 
Government’s Urban Activation Precinct Program identified 
areas suitable for the provision of additional housing to 
assist meet Council’s housing obligations into the future. 
A concentrated housing model has been adopted, with 
housing located in planned precincts rather than dispersed 
throughout urban areas. The additional housing precincts 
are identified on Figure 3(a).

Existing planning controls and policies were reviewed to 
determine their effectiveness in permitting appropriate 
forms of housing to meet the future needs of the 
population. It was found that satisfaction with the built 
form in existing medium and high density residential 
precincts was dependent on the amount and quality of 
landscaping, building separation and underground car 
parking. Therefore the planning controls developed, in 
consultation with an urban design consultant, 
recommended that floor space ratio not be used as a 
control, as it does not include many elements that affect 
the built form.  

The planning controls for the medium and high density 
residential controls are form based controls that aim to 
achieve the desired future character of the locality that 
includes high quality buildings with a limited footprint, 
sited within a landscaped setting.

3.1.7 Vehicle Access And Parking

Desired Outcome

a. Development that provides sufficient and convenient 
parking for residents with vehicular access that is 
simple, safe and direct.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Car parking for dwelling houses should be provided 

behind the front building line 

b. A paved driveway should be provided between the 
required on-site car parking area and a public road.

c.  A driveway should be setback a minimum 0.5 metres 

from side boundaries to provide for landscaping 
between the driveway and the side boundary.

Note:

Refer to Part 1 ‘General’ of the DCP for more detailed parking and 
service vehicle design requirements. 

Notes:

All developments should comply with the minimum building 
setback controls within this DCP which will assist in achieving the

3.1.8 Design Details

Desired Outcome

a. Development compatible with a low density residential 
environment that complements the zone objectives.

Prescriptive Measures  

General

a. Dwelling houses should be oriented primarily towards 

the street and the rear boundary.

b. Extensive blank or unarticulated walls to street 

frontages are discouraged.

c.  Dwelling houses should provide a covered entry to the 
home at least 1.5 metres deep and clearly visible from 
the street.

d. Dwelling houses on corner allotments should be 

designed to provide elevations that address both street 
frontages.

e. Garages should not dominate the facade of the dwelling 
house or the streetscape.  Garage doors should be as 
follows:

 setback 1 metre from the front facade of the home,

 no wider than 6 metres, and

 maximum 2.4 metres high.

Figure 3.1(h): The main entry should be clearly visible from 
the street and sheltered from the weather, and the garages 
set back from the front facade. (E)

Source of photo: Landcom, Built Form Design Guidelines.

Dormer Windows

f.  The design of dormer windows in any attic level should 

comply with the following:

 Dormers should face the street and/or the rear 

property boundary, 

 Dormers should be setdown below the ridge line and 

setback from the side walls, 

 Dormers should not be wider than 1.3 metres, 

 Be vertically proportioned at a ratio of 1.5:1 measured 

from head to sill of the window frame, and

 The number of dormer windows is limited to a 

maximum of two per facade.

View Sharing

g. Development should allow for the reasonable sharing of 

significant views, including water views and iconic 
views, in particular:

 views that have not already been obscured, 

 views from front and rear boundaries whilst in a 

standing position, and

 views from living and entertainment areas 

(including kitchens).

h. Development should allow for the reasonable sharing of 

significant views by: 

 appropriately siting the building, 

 appropriately designing the bulk of the building, 

 using open materials for balustrades on balconies and 

decks, and/or

 new landscaping comprising a light open foliage.

Note: 

View Sharing Principle - Consistent with Planning Principles, 
where an impact on views arises as a result of non-compliance 
with one or more planning controls, even a moderate impact 
may be considered unreasonable. Whereas, with a complying 
proposal, the question should be asked whether a more skilful 
design could provide the applicant with the same development 
potential and amenity and reduce the impact on the views 
of neighbours. If the answer to that question is no, then the 
view impact of a complying development would probably be 
considered acceptable and the view sharing reasonable.

3.2 Medium Density Housing 

This section provides controls for erecting, and undertaking 
alterations and additions to medium density housing 
except for three storey residential flat buildings in the R3 
Medium Density Residential Zone within areas designated 
K(10.5m - 2 storeys) and M(12m - 3 storeys) on the HLEP 
Height of Building Map. Controls for three storey 
residential flat buildings in the R3 Medium Density Zones 
and the R4 High Density Residential Zones, are contained 
in Section 3.3.

The provisions in 3.2 apply to residential development 
which typically includes dwellings that are known as villas, 
town houses, row houses, terrace houses and residential 
flat buildings up to 2 storeys. 

3.2.1 Desired Future Character

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development applications should demonstrate 
compatibility with the following statement of 
desired character: 

Desired Future Character Statement

Areas designated as K(10.5m - 2 storeys) and M(12m - 3 
storeys) on the HLEP Height of Building Map are 
characterised by medium density housing comprising 2-3 
storey town houses and 2-3 storey residential flat buildings 
in a landscaped setting.  The buildings have low pitched 
roofs with wide eaves or flat roofs.  Additional floor space 
is provided within an attic, where the floor area is 
contained wholly within the roofspace.

Development footprints are limited in scale and located to 
achieve setbacks to boundaries incorporating soft 
landscaping. Elements of deep soil landscaping surround 
every building to maintain and enhance the landscape 
quality of established streetscapes and to provide ‘green 
separation’ between neighbouring buildings. Where more 
than one building is provided on-site, the buildings are 
separated by garden areas. The established tree canopy is 
complemented by new trees and shrubs throughout the 
landscaped area.  

Car parking is provided on-site and integrally designed 
into the building to maintain a landscaped area at the 
street frontage. Parking should be predominately in the 
form of basement parking.  

Where parking is provided at grade for town houses, the 
new dwellings address a communal driveway and the 
public domain. Active residential facades and soft 
landscaping along the communal driveway is maximised by 
limiting the proportion of the building facade dedicated 
to garages.

A high standard of architectural and urban design quality is 
achieved. Contemporary buildings utilise facade 
modulation and incorporate shade elements, such as 
pergolas, verandahs and the like. Well-articulated building 
forms combined with carefully-designed facades to achieve 
an appropriate bulk and scale, and contribute to residential 
amenity.

Developments incorporate a mix of dwelling sizes to 
provide housing choice. Developments embody active 
living principles including prioritised pedestrian and cyclist 
entrances to buildings, connectivity to the public domain 
and bicycle parking and storage.

Figure 3.2(a): Town houses with 
basement parking are the most 
effective form of attached or multi 
dwelling housing. Positive 
responses to desired future 
character include deep soil 
landscaping along all site 
boundaries, dwellings that address 
the street or a central walkway, and 
that are not oriented towards 
neighbouring properties, and car 
parking that is concealed below 
ground level. (I)

3-16

Common areas and private open spaces promote positive 
social interaction between residents, security, and private 
amenity for residents. 

Notes:  

A reference in this section to town houses includes all medium 
density attached dwellings and multi dwelling housing as defined 
by the HLEP. 

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

Figure 3.2(b) Residential flat buildings are an effective alternative to town houses. Positive responses to desired future
character include deep soil landscaping along all site boundaries, a limit to the footprint of each building, potential for an attic
storey within a gently pitched roof, dwellings that are oriented toward the front and rear boundaries and car parking that is
concealed below ground level and within the building footprint.(I)

Figure 3.2(c):  Town houses with ground level parking potentially provide for lower site yields and are not the preferred form for 
attached or multi dwelling housing. However where this built form is proposed, positive responses to desired future character 
include driveways that are flanked by landscapåing, visible entrances to every dwelling and facades not dominated by garages.(I)

d. Where a development proposal results in an adjoining 
site within the precinct with no street frontage or a 
primary street frontage of less than 30 metres, 
proponents should demonstrate that orderly and 
economic development of the site can be achieved 
under this DCP.

e. Where a property is likely to be isolated by a proposed 
development and it cannot be demonstrated that the 
site can be developed to its full potential, applicants 
should provide documentary evidence that a genuine 
and reasonable attempt has been made to purchase an 
isolated site based on a fair market value.

Notes:

Refer to Section 1C.2.12 of the DCP for detailed provisions on 
Isolated Sites.

3.2.2 Site Requirements

Desired Outcome

a. Buildings located on consolidated development sites 
that provide soft landscaping surrounding the building 
and limit the number of driveway crossings.

Prescriptive Measures

a. The minimum site width should be 30 metres measured 

at the street frontage. 

b. Sites should not be accessed via a battleaxe driveway 

or right-of-way.

c.  Basement driveways and access stairs should be 
planned and coordinated to minimise the loss of 
landscape open space and deep soil zones.

 Where practicable locate driveway entries beneath 

building envelope.

 Driveways should run perpendicular to the street for 

sites with a regular geometry. 

 Driveways should be consolidated on large sites and 
adjacent development lots where topographically 
possible to avoid large expanses of driveway to street 
frontages. 

Newly developed site

3.2.3 Height

Desired Outcome

a. A built form not exceeding 2 storeys + attic in 

height and comprising town houses and residential 
flat buildings in areas designated K(10.5m - 2 storeys) on 
the HLEP Height of Building Map.

b. A built form not exceeding 3 storeys in  the height and 

comprising town houses in areas designated M(12m - 3 
storeys) on the HLEP Height of Building Map.

Prescriptive Measures

Storeys

a. Sites with the following maximum building heights 

under Clause 4.3 of the HLEP should comply with the 
maximum number of storeys in Table 3.2.3(a).

c.  A transition in building height should be provided at 
sensitive interface areas adjacent to heritage items.

d. To protect the amenity of future residents the finished 
floor level of ground floor apartments should be at or 
above the natural ground level.

e. Developments incorporating mezzanine levels in the 

roof space, should be visually recessive and lightweight 
in design. A light weight design character is achieved by 
roofs that overhang exterior walls which incorporate 
materials or finishes that provide a distinct contrast with 
face brick or rendered masonry.

Notes: 

Building height (or height of building) means the vertical 
distance between ground level (existing) and the highest point 
of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding 
communication devices, antennae, satellite dishes, masts, 
flagpoles, chimneys, flues and the like. 

Storey means a space within a building that is situated between 
one floor level and the floor level next above, or if there is no floor 
above, the ceiling or roof above, but does not include:

(a) a space that contains only a lift shaft, stairway or meter room, 
or

(b) a mezzanine, or

(c) an attic.

b. Basement car parking that protrudes more than 1 metre 

above existing ground level is counted as a storey.

Basement means the space of a building where the floor level 
of that space is predominantly below ground level (existing) and 
where the floor level of the storey immediately above is less than 
1 metre above ground level (existing).

Roof Design

f.  Pitched roofs with wide eaves are encouraged for 

compatibility with streetscape character and 
sun control.

g. Pitched roofs should not be steeper than 25 degrees, 
other than gable ends that predominately face a side 
boundary when used as a minor design feature. 

h. Gable roof ends should form a minor design feature of a 
building’s facade and pitch from the external wall of the 
building, with the exception of eaves.

i.  Flat roofs that are surrounded by parapets should be 
avoided except when used as a minor design feature.

Attic Design 

Figure 3.2(f): Building Height Controls - 2 storey town 
houses with a maximum roof pitch of 25 degrees and

 Roof span should not be more than 15 metres;

 Internal height should not be more than 3.5metres 

(measured from attic floor to roof ridge); and

 Roofs should be pitched or setback from exterior 

walls and should not be pitched from any point above 
a verandah or balcony.

k.  The external walls of the building should not extend 

above the attic floor level.

l.  The design of dormer windows in any attic level should 

comply with the following:

 Dormers should be setdown below the ridge line and 

setback from the side walls, 

 Dormers should not be wider than 2 metres and the 
sides of adjoining dormers should be separated by at 
least 2 metres, and

 Preferably face the front and rear boundaries of 

the site.

m. Roof fixtures and lift overruns or service plants should 
be incorporated into the design of the roof to minimise 
visual intrusiveness and support an integrated 
building design.

b. Setbacks that preserve and protect existing trees 

around the perimeter of sites and provide effective deep 
soil areas that are able to create a garden setting, 
including substantial tree canopy to all sides of the 
building.

Prescriptive Measures

d. Units should be oriented to front or rear boundaries. 

Where balconies are oriented to side boundaries, they 
should have a setback of 6 metres.

Notes:  

Designated roads

Designated roads are Council identified roads that require 
development to have an increased setback from the road edge, 
consistent with the established streetscape. A list of designated 
roads is provided in Annexure C. 

Light weight verandahs or pergolas typically comprise timber 
or metal frames. They are not supported by brick or concrete 
columns and do not have brick or concrete balustrades and should 
not include the main roof of the building.

3.2.5 Building Form and Separation

Desired Outcome

a. Articulated buildings that are limited in width and depth, 

and separated by garden areas. 

Prescriptive Measures

Floorplates

a. Floorplates of residential flat buildings should have a 
maximum dimension of 35 metres measured in a 
perpendicular direction between opposing exterior walls 
at any point.  Balconies and terraces may project beyond 
this maximum provided that there is no adverse impact 
in relation to shadowing or privacy.

b. Floorplates exceeding 25 metres for residential flat 

buildings should incorporate a distinct indentation which 
measures at least 4 metres by 4 metres and should 
create the appearance of two separate “building 
pavilions” rather than a single building mass. The 
appearance of separate pavilions should be accentuated 
by individual roofs above each pavilion element. 

Figure 3.2(k): Internal separation and articulation of town 

house buildings.(E)

Articulation

c.  All facades should include elements that contribute to a 
variety of building forms and minimise scale, such as 
sunshades, balconies and verandahs that display a light 
weight design character. Wall planes of buildings should 
not exceed the following lengths in Table 3.2.5(b) 
without an offset of at least 1 metre and a 
corresponding change in roof form:

d. Buildings should include structural elements such as 

sunshades, balconies and verandahs that provide variety 
in the built form.

e. All town houses should have a covered entry to the 

dwelling at least 1.5 metres deep, with a direct line of 
sight towards the street, or to a common walkway on 
the site.

f.  To maintain the design integrity of buildings the 
enclosure of existing balconies should not occur.

g. Development form and scale should be guided by the 
principles and recommended guidelines for managing 
the development scale, relationship to context and 
elements that contribute to relevant character 
influences for a specific area contained with the 
Apartment Design Guide Part 2.

Materials and Finishes

h. Facades should incorporate a mix of compatible 

materials such as face or rendered brickwork and 
contrasting areas of light weight cladding. 

i.  Sunscreens and awnings comprised of timber battens 

or metal frames are encouraged.

Notes: 

A habitable room is any room or area used for normal domestic 
activities, including living, dining, family, lounge, bedrooms, study, 
kitchen, sun room and playroom.

A prescriptive floorplate control does not apply to town houses 
because the floorplate of a town house will be limited in depth 
given the need for cross flow ventilation in each dwelling 
per Section 3.2.9.  In addition the DCP requires more facade 
articulation of town houses given the potential for longer 
elevations.

structure or hard paved area.  

The applicant is encouraged to incorporate species from Council’s 
publication “Indigenous Plants for the Bushland Shire” available at 
Council’s website hornsby.nsw.gov.au. 

Deep soil zones are areas of soil not covered by buildings or 
structures within a development. They exclude basement car 
parks, services, impervious surfaces including driveways, paths 
and roof areas.

Deep soil zones have important environmental benefits, such as 
allowing infiltration of rainwater to the water table and reducing 
stormwater runoff, promoting healthy growth of large trees with 
large canopies and protecting existing mature trees which assist 
with temperature reduction in urban environments.

3.3 Residential Flat Buildings (3 Storeys)

This section provides controls for erecting , and 
undertaking alterations and additions to, a residential flat 
building in the R3 Medium Density Residential Zone and 
the R4 High Density Residential Zone, within the area 
designated as M (12m - 3 storeys) on the HLEP Height of 
Building map. 

3.3.1 Desired Future Character

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area.

Prescriptive Measures

b. Development applications should demonstrate 
compatibility with the following statement of 
desired character: 

Desired Future Character Statement

The locality is characterised by 3 storey residential flat 
buildings in a landscaped setting. The buildings have low 
pitched or flat roofs with wide eaves.  

Development footprints are limited in scale and located to 
achieve setbacks to boundaries incorporating soft 
landscaping. Where more than one building is provided 
on-site, the buildings are separated by garden areas. The 
established tree canopy is complemented by new trees 
and shrubs throughout the landscaped area.  

Car parking is provided on-site and integrally designed into 
the building in the form of basement parking.

A high standard of architectural and urban design quality is 
achieved. Contemporary buildings utilise facade 
modulation and incorporate shade elements, such as 
pergolas, verandahs and the like. Developments 
incorporate a mix of dwelling sizes to provide housing 
choice. Developments embody active living principles 
including prioritised pedestrian and cyclist entrances to 
buildings, connectivity to the public domain and bicycle 
parking and storage.

Notes: 

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

Figure 3.3(a): Example of Desired Character - 3 storey residential flat building.(I)

3-44

3.3.2 Design Quality - SEPP 65

Desired Outcome

a. A built form which responds to the site, locality and 
landscape and includes appropriate innovation to 
respond to technical, social, aesthetic, economic and 
environmental challenges.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development applications should be accompanied by a 
design verification from a qualified designer, including a 
statement that: 

 he or she designed, or directed the design, of the 

development, 

 that the design quality principles set out in Schedule 
1 of State Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - 
Design Quality of Residential Apartment 
Development are achieved, and

 the design is consistent with the objectives of the 

Apartment Design Guide

Note:  

Development applications should be accompanied by a statement 
of environmental effects which includes the following:

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

quality principles set out in State Environmental Planning 
Policy No 65 - Design Quality of Residential Apartment 
Development, namely:

context and neighbourhood character; built form and 
scale; density; sustainability; landscape; amenity; 
safety; housing diversity and social interaction; and 
aesthetics.

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

criteria in Part 3 and Part 4 of the Apartment Design Guide.

 drawings of the proposed development in the context of 
surrounding development, including the streetscape;

 demonstration of compliance with building heights, 

setbacks and building envelope controls marked on plans, 
sections and elevations;

 drawings of the proposed landscape area, including species 
selected and materials to be used, presented in the context 
of the proposed development and the surrounding 
development and its context;

 if the proposed development is within an area in which the 
built form is changing, statements of the existing and likely 
future contexts;

 photomontages of the proposed development in the 

context of surrounding development;

 a sample board of the proposed materials and colours of 

the facade; and

 detailed drawings of proposed facades.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | RESIDENTIAL(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019)3.3.3 Site Requirements

Desired Outcome

a. Buildings located on consolidated development sites 
that provide soft landscaping surrounding the building 
and limit the number of driveway crossings.

Prescriptive Measures

a. The minimum site width should be 30 metres measured 

at the primary street frontage. 

b. Where a development proposal results in an adjoining 
site within the precinct with no street frontage or a 
primary street frontage of less than 30 metres, 
proponents should demonstrate that orderly and 
economic development of the site can be achieved 
under this DCP. 

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | RESIDENTIAL
THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019

3-45

c. Where a property is likely to be isolated by a proposed 
development and it cannot be demonstrated that the 
site can be developed to its full potential, applicants 
should provide documentary evidence that a genuine 
and reasonable attempt has been made to purchase an 
isolated site based on a fair market value. 

d. Basement driveways and access stairs should be 
planned and coordinated to minimise the loss of 
landsape open space and deep soil zones.

 Where practicable locate driveway entries beneath 

building envelope.

 Driveways should run perpendicular to the street for 

sites with a regular geometry. 

 Driveways should be consolidated on large sites and 
adjacent development lots where topographically 
possible to avoid large expanses of driveway to street 
frontages. 

Notes:

Refer to Section 1C.2.12 of the DCP for detailed provisions on 
Isolated Sites.

maximum of 1.5 metres above natural ground level. 

g. Low pitched or flat roofs with wide eaves are 

encouraged for compatibility with streetscape character 
and sun control.

h. Flat roofs that are surrounded by parapets should be 
avoided except when used as a minor design feature.

i.  Roof fixtures and lift overruns or service plants should 
be incorporated into the design of the roof to minimise 
visual intrusiveness and support an integrated 
building design. 

Notes: 

Building height (or height of building) means the vertical 
distance between ground level (existing) and the highest point 
of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding 
communication devices, antennae, satellite dishes, masts, 
flagpoles, chimneys, flues and the like. 

Storey means a space within a building that is situated between 
one floor level and the floor level next above, or if there is no floor 
above, the ceiling or roof above, but does not include:

Deep soil zones are areas of soil not covered by buildings or 
structures within a development. They exclude basement car 
parks, services, impervious surfaces including driveways, paths 
and roof areas.

Deep soil zones have important environmental benefits, such as 
allowing infiltration of rainwater to the water table and reducing 
stormwater runoff, promoting healthy growth of large trees with 
large canopies and protecting existing mature trees which assist 
with temperature reduction in urban environments.

3.4 Residential Flat Buildings (5 Storeys)

This section provides controls for erecting, and undertaking 
alterations and additions to, residential flat buildings in the 
R4 High Density Residential Zone, within the area 
designated as P (17.5m - 5 storeys) on the HLEP Height of 
Building map, with the exception of land in Beecroft that is 
addressed in Part 9 of this DCP.

3.4.1 Desired Future Character

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area.

Prescriptive Measures

b. Development applications should demonstrate 
compatibility with the following statement of 
desired character: 

Desired Future Character Statement

The locality is characterised by 5 storey residential flat 
buildings in landscaped settings with underground 
car parking.

Developments complement and enhance the adjacent 
public domain environment and building footprints 
maintain landscape corridors around and through 
development sites. 

The established tree canopy is complemented by new 
trees and shrubs throughout all gardens. Facade widths 
are limited or divided into well-articulated pavilion forms, 
avoiding the appearance of a continuous wall of 
development. 

Facades are not fully rendered and masonry walls are 
confined to low level facades. Mid level and upper storey 
building facades incorporate a range of materials and 
finishes including face brick, walls of windows, steel 
framed balconies with balustrades of steel or glass and 
operable louvres for privacy, shade and glare control. 

Roofs are flat pitched without parapets to minimise the 
height of exterior walls, incorporating eaves which cast 
shadows across the top storey walls.

Balconies provide outdoor living areas which wrap around 
the corners of the buildings, providing usable open space 
as well as articulation in built form. 

Developments embody active living principles including 
bicycle parking and storage, prioritised pedestrian and 
cyclist entrances to buildings, and connectivity to the 
public domain.

Note:  

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

3.4.2 Design Quality - SEPP 65

Desired Outcome

a. A built form which responds to the site, locality and 
landscape and includes appropriate innovation to 
respond to technical, social, aesthetic, economic and 
environmental challenges.

Prescriptive Measures

b. Development applications should be accompanied by a 
design verification from a qualified designer, including a 
statement that: 

 he or she designed, or directed the design, of the 

development, 

 that the design quality principles set out in State 

Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - Design Quality 
of Residential Apartment Development, are achieved, 
and

 the design is consistent with the objectives of the 

Apartment Design Guide.

Note:  

Development applications should be accompanied by a statement 
of environmental effects which includes the following:

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

quality principles set out in Schedule 1 of State 
Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - Design Quality of 
Residential Apartment Development, namely:

context and neighbourhood character; built form and 
scale; density; sustainability; landscape; amenity; 
safety; housing diversity and social interaction and 
aesthetics.

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

criteria in Part 3 and Part 4 of the Apartment Design Guide;

 drawings of the proposed development in the context of 
surrounding development, including the streetscape;

 demonstration of compliance with building heights, setbacks 
and building envelope controls marked on plans, sections and 
elevations;

 drawings of the proposed landscape area, including species 

selected and materials to be used, presented in the context of 
the proposed development and the surrounding development 
and its context;

 if the proposed development is within an area in which the built 
form is changing, statements of the existing and likely future 
contexts;

 photomontages of the proposed development in the context of 

surrounding development;

 a sample board of the proposed materials and colours of the 

facade; and 

 detailed drawings of proposed facades.

3.4.3 Site Requirements

Desired Outcome

a. Buildings located on consolidated development sites 
that provide soft landscaping surrounding the building 
and limit the number of driveway crossings.

Prescriptive Measures

a. The minimum site width should be 30 metres measured 

at the primary street frontage. 

b. Where a development proposal results in an adjoining 
site  within the precinct with no street frontage or a 
primary street frontage of less than 30 metres, 
proponents should demonstrate that orderly and 
economic development of the site can be achieved 
under this DCP.

c.  Where a property is likely to be isolated by a proposed 
development and it cannot be demonstrated that the 
site can be developed to its full potential, applicants 
should provide documentary evidence that a genuine 
and reasonable attempt has been made to purchase an 
isolated site based on a fair market value 

d. Basement driveways and access stairs should be 
planned and coordinated to minimise the loss of 
landsape open space and deep soil zones.

 Where practicable locate driveway entries beneath 

building envelope.

 Driveways should run perpendicular to the street for 

sites with a regular geometry. 

 Driveways should be consolidated on large sites and 
adjacent development lots where topographically 
possible to avoid large expanses of driveway to street 
frontages. 

Notes: Refer to Section 1C.2.12 of the DCP for detailed provisions 
on Isolated Sites.

Notes:  

Landscaped area means a part of a site used for growing plants, 
grasses and trees, but does not include any building, structure or 
hard paved area.  

Landscaped area between 2 buildings on a development site 
is able to be erected above a basement, notwithstanding the 
definition of landscaped area above, except where deep soil is 
specifically required.

The applicant is encouraged to incorporate species from Council’s 
publication Indigenous Plants for the Bushland Shire available at 
Council’s website hornsby.nsw.gov.au.  

Rear Boundary deep soil landscape areas are not required where 
a Key Development Principles Diagram includes a rear laneway or 
shareway located in the rear set-back. The laneway or shareway 
should have a continuous landscaped verge of at least 2 metres 
wide between the rear boundary and the laneway or shareway.

Deep soil zones are areas of soil not covered by buildings or 
structures within a development. They exclude basement car 
parks, services, impervious surfaces including driveways, paths 
and roof areas.

Deep soil zones have important environmental benefits, such as 
allowing infiltration of rainwater to the water table and reducing 
stormwater runoff, promoting healthy growth of large trees with 
large canopies and protecting existing mature trees which assist 
with temperature reduction in urban environments.

and natural cross ventilation.

Note:

SEPP -BASIX 2004 requires a BASIX certificate for new dwellings 
to facilitate energy efficient housing.

As the 5 storey buildings are being constructed within a 
redevelopment precinct, the level of sunlight access required 
needs to take into account the overshadowing that will occur in 
this precinct from approved developments on adjacent sites and 
if no adjacent application is approved, a compliant development 
envelope on a neighbouring site. So, for example, this may 
require the proposed residential flat building envelope to 
comprise larger units on the lower levels that will be subject to 
overshadowing, with smaller units on upper levels that enjoy 
improved sunlight access.

To reflect the established pattern of detached-dwellings:  limit 
the width of new facades that would be visible from any 
street, and divide the floorspace of every new building into 
well-articulated pavilion forms that are separated by 
courtyards with canopy trees.

Development should take into account potential stormwater 
inundation and overland flow path provisions.

Siting + design should provide at least two hours sunlight 
daily for living areas in 70% of new dwellings.

Design quality of facades should respond to visibility from all 
street frontages.

3.5 Residential Flat Buildings (6 or more Storeys)

This section provides controls for erecting, and undertaking 
alterations and additions to, a residential flat building in the 
R4 High Density Residential Zone, within the area 
designated as S to AA (except W1) (6 storeys to 22 
storeys) on the HLEP Height of Building map. 

Desired Future Character Statement                                                               
(excluding Pound Road, Hornsby Precinct)

The locality is characterised by residential flat buildings of 6 
or more storeys in height in landscaped settings with 
underground car parking.

3.5.1 Desired Future Character

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area. 

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development applications should demonstrate 
compatibility with the following statements of 
desired character: 

Development footprints maintain landscape corridors 
around and through development sites. The established 
tree canopy is complemented by new trees and shrubs 
throughout all gardens. Facade widths are limited, 
avoiding the appearance of a continuous wall of 
development. Buildings are integrated into a campus like 
setting with large areas of consolidated public and 
communal open space. 

Balconies provide outdoor living areas which wrap around 
the corners of the buildings, providing usable open space 
as well as articulation in built form. 

Developments embody active living principles including 
bicycle parking and storage, prioritised pedestrian and 
cyclist entrances to buildings, and connectivity to the 
public domain.

Figure 3.5(a): Example of Desired Character - 8 storey 
residential flat building (excluding Pound Road, Hornsby 

precinct).(I)

Desired Future Character Statement                                                                        
(Pound Road, Hornsby Precinct)

Balconies provide outdoor living areas, providing usable 
open space as well as articulation in built form. 

The locality is characterised by residential flat buildings of 
up to 9 storeys in height, with commercial floorspace on 
the ground floor that provides an active frontage to the 
public domain.

Developments embody active living principles including 
bicycle parking and storage, prioritised pedestrian and 
cyclist entrances to buildings, and connectivity to the 
public domain.

Note:

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

Development footprints incorporate a podium of 3 storeys 
that is consistent with the existing built form in the 
precinct.  Ground floors incorporate a pedestrian colonnade 
along the Pacific Highway. The levels above the podium are 
setback providing a human scale to the precinct, 
preserving key vistas and managing residential amenity.  
Vehicular access is provided via the accessway at the rear 
western boundary of the precinct.

Buildings are integrated into a campus like setting with 
large areas of consolidated public and communal open 
space. Communal open space is predominantly located 
between the 2 residential towers. Development is setback 
from the Pacific Highway and other public areas to ensure 
continuity of the building alignment and to allow for 
landscape corridors with trees that will mature to a height 
above the podium.

3.5.2 Design Quality - SEPP 65

Desired Outcome

a. A built form which responds to the site, locality and 
landscape and includes appropriate innovation to 
respond to technical, social, aesthetic, economic and 
environmental challenges.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development applications should be accompanied by a 
design verification from a qualified designer, including a 
statement that: 

 he or she designed, or directed the design, of 

the development, 

 that the design quality principles set out in State 

Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - Design Quality 
of Residential Apartment Development are achieved, 
and

 the design is consistent with the objectives of the 

Apartment Design Guide.

Note:  

Development applications should be accompanied by a statement 
of environmental effects which includes the following:

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

quality principles set out in Schedule 1 of State 
Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - Design Quality of 
Residential Apartment Development, namely:

context and neighbourhood character; built form and 
scale; density; sustainability; landscape; amenity; 
safety; housing diversity and social interaction and 
aesthetics.

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

criteria in Part 3 and Part 4 of the Apartment Design Guide.

 drawings of the proposed development in the context of 
surrounding development, including the streetscape;

 demonstration of compliance with building heights, 

setbacks and building envelope controls marked on plans, 
sections and elevations;

 drawings of the proposed landscape area, including species 
selected and materials to be used, presented in the context 
of the proposed development and the surrounding 
development and its context;

 if the proposed development is within an area in which the 
built form is changing, statements of the existing and likely 
future contexts;

 photomontages of the proposed development in the 

context of surrounding development;

3.5.3 Site Requirements

Desired Outcome

a. Buildings located on consolidated development sites 
that provide soft landscaping surrounding the building 
and limit the number of driveway crossings. 

Prescriptive Measures

a. The minimum site width measured at the primary street 

frontage should comply with Table 3.6.3(a). 

Table 3.5.3(a): Minimum Site Width

Area

Minimum Site Frontage

All Areas (Excluding Pound Road, 
Hornsby)

25m

b. Where a development proposal results in an adjoining 
site within the precinct with no street frontage or a 
primary street frontage of less than that required in the 
Table 3.6.3(a), proponents should demonstrate that 
orderly and economic development of the site can be 
achieved under this DCP. 

c.  Where a property is likely to be isolated by a proposed 
development and it cannot be demonstrated that the 
site can be developed to its full potential, applicants 
should provide documentary evidence that a genuine 
and reasonable attempt has been made to purchase an 
isolated site based on a fair market value 

d. Basement and services provision should be planned and 
coordinated to minimise the loss of landscaped open 
space deep soil zones. Where necessary services (such 
as OSD) are required in the side setbacks, an area with 
minimum dimensions 2m x 2m should be retained as 
deep soil to allow for planting of large trees.

Notes: Refer to Section 1C.2.12 of the DCP for detailed provisions 
on Isolated Sites.

3.5.4 Height

Desired Outcome

a. A built form in accordance with the Height of 

g. Within the Oxford Street, Epping Precinct, a broad 

podium should be provided with a height of 2-3 storeys 
and consistent with the existing built form in the 
precinct.

Building Map in the HLEP and comprising residential 
flat buildings.

Roof Design

h. Flat or very gentle pitched roofs without parapets to 
minimise the height of exterior walls, incorporating 
eaves immediately above and beneath the penthouse 
storeys to cast shadows across the top-storey walls.

i.  Roof fixtures and lift overruns or service plants should 
be incorporated into the design of the roof to minimise 
visual intrusiveness and support an integrated 
building design.

Notes:

Building height (or height of building) means the vertical 
distance between ground level (existing) and the highest point 
of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding 
communication devices, antennae, satellite dishes, masts, 
flagpoles, chimneys, flues and the like.

Storey means a space within a building that is situated between 
one floor level and the floor level next above, or if there is no floor 
above, the ceiling or roof above, but does not include:

(a) a space that contains only a lift shaft, stairway or meter room, 
or

(b) a mezzanine, or

(c) an attic.

Basement means the space of a building where the floor level 
of that space is predominantly below ground level (existing) and 
where the floor level of the storey immediately above is less than 
1 metre above ground level (existing).

A transition in building height should be provided at sensitive 
interface areas adjacent to heritage items and Heritage 
Conservation Areas.  Refer to Part 9 Heritage of this DCP for 
additional heritage controls. 

Height controls (ex Pound Road and Oxford Street, Epping 
Precinct) are based on a typical residential floor to floor height of 
3 metres, with a 1.5 metre allowance for roof articulation and a 1 
metre basement projection.

Height controls (Pound Road and Oxford Street, Epping Precinct)

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to land within the business 
areas of Hornsby Shire. The business areas include land 
within the following zones: B1 Neighbourhood Centre, B2 
Local Centre, B3 Commercial Core, B4 Mixed Use, B5 
Business Development and B6 Enterprise Corridor.

The planning controls for the business areas are informed 
by the Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Subregional Employment 
Study (2008) and the Dural Service Centre Retail and 
Commercial Study (2009).  In addition, the planning 
controls for the Mixed Use Precincts in Section 4.4 of this 
chapter are informed by the Hornsby Shire Housing 
Strategy (2010). The commercial centres in Section 4.4 
were identified by the Housing Strategy as being suitable 
for additional housing, in a mixed use built form, to assist 
meet Council’s housing obligations into the future. 

The planning controls for Epping Town Centre in Section 
4.6 were informed by the State Government’s identification 
of the Epping Town Centre Urban Activation Precinct and 
the Epping Town Centre Structure and Public Domain Plans 
prepared by the Department of Planning & Environment  
for the Precinct.

Hornsby Shire’s business lands are competitively placed to 
attract business activity. Development in business areas 
will incorporate a range of employment generating land 
uses such as shops, offices, community facilities and 
services. Development should reinforce the role and 
function of the centre under the commercial centres 
hierarchy. In particular, Hornsby Town Centre, being a major 
centre, should be a major shopping and business centre 
serving the immediate and Subregional residential 
population with a shopping mall, Council offices, taller 
office and residential buildings, central community facilities 
and a minimum of 8,000 jobs.

Development is to be sited and designed to be 
environmentally sustainable, minimise land use conflicts 
and operate under appropriate environmental management 
measures to manage waste and minimise air, water and 
noise pollution. Development will be compatible with the 
existing or desired future character of the commercial area.  
Development will provide attractive, active and vibrant 
streetscapes and public domains. In mixed use 
developments this will involve an active commercial 
ground floor providing a broad podium for dwellings

Where sites contain a heritage item, are in the vicinity of a 
heritage item or within a conservation area, the provisions 
of Part 9 Heritage of the DCP apply. Changes to facades, 
setbacks, awnings and the like may not be feasible where 
heritage significance would be impacted upon. 

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | BUSINESS(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)4.1 Commercial Centres Hierarchy

4.1.1 Commercial Centres Hierarchy - 

Villages and Small Villages

4-5

f.  The smaller local centres known as Villages and Small 

Villages are identified in the commercial centres 
hierarchy. These centres should be the preferred location 
for small and medium scale commercial/retail uses that 
serve the local community and only have limited office 
and bulky good retail functions.

Neighbourhood Centres

g. Neighbourhood Centres provide retail and other 

services to the immediately surrounding residential 
area. The role of Neighbourhood Centres to serve the 
needs of local residents should be reinforced. To ensure 
that Neighbourhood Centres do not undermine the 
strength of the commercial environment of surrounding 
larger centres, commercial/retail uses that serve the 
wider community should not be located within 
Neighbourhood Centres.

Enterprise Corridors

h. Parts of Pennant Hills Road and the Pacific Highway 

function as Enterprise Corridors providing 
accommodation for local and regional services that 
benefit from high levels of passing traffic such as 
start-up offices, light industry, motor showrooms, 
building supplies and bulky good retail.

Hornsby

Desired Outcome

a. Development that reinforces the role and function of the 

centre in the commercial centres hierarchy.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development should reinforce the commercial centre 
hierarchy identified at Figure 4.1(a) and described in 
the following:

Major Centres

b. Hornsby Town Centre is a Major Centre serving the 

North Subregion. This area should provide much of the 
civic, cultural, retail and economic requirements for the 
Subregion. The centre should develop additional 
employment generating activities including offices 
and services. 

Town Centres

c.  Town Centres should provide a wide range of goods and 
services to the community.  Trips to larger centres such 
as Hornsby Town Centre should only be required for 
higher order commodities.

d. While Epping has a Town Centre status within the 

Metropolitan Strategy, the component of the centre 
within Hornsby Shire operates predominately as a 
Village and this role should be maintained.

Stand Alone Shopping Centres

e. Carlingford is a Stand Alone Shopping Centre that is 

internalised and located away from other commercial 
areas.  It contains many of the attributes of a Town 
Centre and may have the potential to become a 
traditional Town Centre in the long-term.

 has an active frontage to the public domain.

Notes:

d. A transition in building height should be provided at 
sensitive interface areas adjacent to heritage items.

Floor Space Ratio

Building height (or height of building) means the vertical 
distance between ground level (existing) and the highest point 
of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding 
communication devices, antennae, satellite dishes, masts, 
flagpoles, chimneys, flues and the like.

e. The maximum floor space ratio for business lands shall 
be in accordance with the HLEP Floor Space Ratio Map 
as follows:

Storey means a space within a building that is situated between 
one floor level and the floor level next above, or if there is no floor 
above, the ceiling or roof above, but does not include:

Table 4.2.1(b): Summary of HLEP FSR Provisions

f.  On identified sites, Council may consent to 

development that results in a variation to the floor space 
ratio shown on the Floor Space Ratio Map. The 
requirements regarding the floor space ratio variation 
are provided in Clause 4.4 of the HLEP.

A mixed use building described above comprises a building with 
a commercial podium and residential floors above.

Shop top housing means one or more dwellings located above 
ground floor retail premises or business premises.

Basement means the space of a building where the floor level 
of that space is predominantly below ground level (existing) and 
where the floor level of the storey immediately above is less than 
1 metre above ground level (existing).

Refer to Part 9 Heritage of this DCP for additional 
heritage controls.

As detailed in Clause 4.5 of the HLEP, the floor space ratio 
of buildings on a site is the ratio of the gross floor area of all 
buildings within the site to the site area. See the HLEP for the 
definition of gross floor area.

Storey controls are based on a typical industrial floor to floor 
height of 5 metres, commercial floor to floor height of 4 metres, 
residential floor to floor height of 3 metres and some roof 
projections. The storey controls provided in the DCP are a best fit 
for the height controls (metres) provided in the HLEP.

4.2.9 Public Domain and Traffic 
Management Works

Desired Outcome

a. A public domain that encourages vitality around and 

within development precincts. 

b. Traffic management works that provide for the safe 
and efficient movement of vehicles to, from and 
within precincts. 

Prescriptive Measures

Public Domain

a. Development of the public domain should make each 

precinct an attractive place that encourages 
development and provides amenity for workers, 
residents and visitors.

b. Embellishment of the public domain should include 

street furniture, new street plantings, and 
footpath improvements.

c.  Dedicated pedestrian paths should be provided in front 

of businesses and continuous awnings should be 
provided along principal active street frontages.

d. Pedestrian linkages shown on the Town Centre 
Masterplans  (see Section 4.3) and Town Centre 
Linkage diagrams (see Annexure B) should be provided 
and reinforced as safe, accessible and vibrant 
pedestrian areas.

e. Mixed use development within centres should enhance 
the role of the public domain as a meeting and gathering 
place and should encourage active use of the public 
domain through active street frontages. 

f.  Balconies should not be located on, or overhang the 

road reservation.

g. For development incorporating shopfront awnings, the 
awnings should be continuous and setback from the 
edge of the kerb in accordance with Council or the 
Roads and Maritime Services requirements.

Outdoor Dining 

h. Outdoor dining areas should be located in areas with 
good amenity, landscape, outlook, solar access in 
winter, shading in summer and a compatible local 
traffic environment.

Note:  

Outdoor dining proposed on Council land should comply with 
Council’s Outdoor Dining Code.

4.2.10 Design Details

Desired Outcome

b. Corner buildings should be designed to:

 address both streets, 

a. Development that contributes positively to the 

streetscape and the creation of a vibrant active precinct.

 incorporate distinctive features to enhance the 

streetscape, and 

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Building design should:

 have an external appearance that provides for a 

distinctive base, middle and top, 

 provide active commercial ground floor uses that are 
at the same general level as the public footpath and 
are accessible directly from the public domain, 

 provide frontages on upper levels that facilitate 

passive surveillance of the street, 

 incorporate awnings that relate to the architecture of 
the facade and provide for continuous shelter for 
pedestrians, and

 embody active living principles.

 incorporate a splayed or square recess treatment to 
give  form to the intersection and provide more 
circulation space for pedestrians at the corner.

c.  Roof fixtures and lift overruns or service plants should 
be incorporated into the design of the roof to minimise 
visual intrusiveness and support an integrated 
building design.

Note: 

These controls apply to all developments unless contrary to the 
Masterplans that prevail in the event of any inconsistency.

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

Facades

d. Continuous active frontages are to incorporate windows 
and doors and avoid long expanses of blank walls along 
street frontages or other public areas.

e. Infill buildings should be designed to reinforce 

continuity, symmetry and unity in the streetscape (see 
Figure 4.2(q)).

f.  Materials should relate to the context of buildings within 

the area to achieve continuity and harmony.

g. Large areas of glass may be included, however, mirror 
glass with a reflectivity in excess of 15 percent should 
be avoided.

h. Where adjacent to bushland areas, buildings should 

have recessive colours and external finishes consistent 
with the nearby bushland areas (i.e. grey greens, grey 
blues, browns etc).

i.  A balance between horizontal and vertical elements 
should be provided through careful placement of 
windows, colour patterns and signage.

j.  Security screens, grilles and bars should provide 

minimum 60 percent transparency.

glass that contrast the weight of masonry walls, with 
operable louvres for privacy, shade and glare control.

a. A built form which responds to the site, locality and 
landscape and includes appropriate innovation to 
respond to technical, social, aesthetic, economic and 
environmental challenges.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development applications should be accompanied by a 
design verification from a qualified designer, including a 
statement that: 

 he or she designed, or directed the design, of the 

development, 

 that the design quality principles set out in State 

Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - Design Quality 
of Apartment Development are achieved, and

 the design is consistent with the objectives of the 

Apartment Design Guide.

Note:  

Development applications should be accompanied by a statement 
of environmental effects which includes the following:

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

quality principles set out in Schedule 1 of State 
Environmental Planning Policy No 65 - Design Quality of 
Apartment Development, namely:

 context and neighbourhood character; built form and 
scale; density; sustainability; landscape; amenity; 
safety; housing diversity and social interaction; and 
aesthetics.

 an explanation of how the design addresses the design 

criteria of Part 3 and Part 4 of the Apartment Design Guide.

 drawings of the proposed development in the context of 
surrounding development, including the streetscape;

 demonstration of compliance with building heights, 

setbacks and building envelope controls marked on plans, 
sections and elevations;

 drawings of the proposed landscape area, including species 
selected and materials to be used, presented in the context 
of the proposed development and the surrounding 
development and its context;

 if the proposed development is within an area in which the 
built form is changing, statements of the existing and likely 
future contexts;

 photomontages of the proposed development in the 

context of surrounding development; 

 a sample board of the proposed materials and colours of 

the facade; and 

 detailed drawings of proposed facades.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | BUSINESS(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)4-39

4.4.3 Site Requirements

Desired Outcome

a. Buildings located on consolidated development sites 
that achieve desired urban design outcomes and 
efficient use of land to avoid the creation of 
isolated sites.

Prescriptive Measures

a. The minimum site width should be 30 metres measured 

at the street frontage.

b. Where a development proposal results in an adjoining 
site within the precinct with no street frontage or a 
primary street frontage of less than 30 metres, 
proponents should demonstrate that orderly and 
economic development of the site can be achieved 
under this DCP.

c.  Where a property is likely to be isolated by a proposed 
development and it cannot be demonstrated that the 
site can be developed to its full potential, applicants 
should provide documentary evidence that a genuine 
and reasonable attempt has been made to purchase an 
isolated site based on a fair market value. 

Notes:

Refer to Section 1C.2.12 of the DCP for detailed provisions on 
Isolated Sites.

4.4.4 Scale 

Desired Outcome

a. Development with a scale compatible with the role and 
function of the centre under the commercial centres 
hierarchy. 

b. Mixed use commercial and residential multi-unit housing 
development not exceeding 5 or 10 storeys in height.

Prescriptive Measures

Height

a. Sites with the following maximum building height under 

Clause 4.3 of the HLEP should comply with the 
maximum number of storeys in Table 4.4.4(a). 

Table 4.4.4(a): Translation of Height to Storeys

b. Basement car parking that protrudes more than 1 metre 

above existing ground level is counted as a storey. 

Floor Space Ratio

f.  The maximum floor space ratio for business lands shall 
be in accordance with the HLEP Floor Space Ratio Map 
as follows:

Table 4.4.4(b): Summary of HLEP FSR Provisions

HLEP Area

Maximum Floor Space Ratio

D

N

0.5:1 (+ FSR variations for Area 5)

1:1 (+ FSR variations for Area 5)

g. On identified sites, Council may consent to 

development that results in a variation to the floor space 
ratio shown on the Floor Space Ratio Map. The 
requirements regarding the floor space ratio variation 
are provided in Clause 4.4 of the HLEP.

Notes:

Building height (or height of building) means the vertical 
distance between ground level (existing) and the highest point 
of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding 
communication devices, antennae, satellite dishes, masts, 
flagpoles, chimneys, flues and the like.

Storey means a space within a building that is situated between 
one floor level and the floor level next above, or if there is no floor 
above, the ceiling or roof above, but does not include:

(a) a space that contains only a lift shaft, stairway or meter room, 
or

c.  Commercial uses, including shops and offices, should 
be confined to the lower 2 storeys, providing a broad 
“podium” for dwellings from level 3.

(b) a mezzanine, or

(c) an attic.

d. Dwellings may be located on level 2 within the podium 

and may incorporate a component at ground level facing 
a side street or lane provided that they would not 
interrupt the desired continuity of commercial activity.

e. A transition in building height should be provided at 
sensitive interface areas adjacent to heritage items.

A mixed use building described above comprises a building with 
a commercial podium and residential floors above.

Basement means the space of a building where the floor level 
of that space is predominantly below ground level (existing) and 
where the floor level of the storey immediately above is less than 
1 metre above ground level (existing).

As detailed in Clause 4.5 of the HLEP, the floor space ratio 
of buildings on a site is the ratio of the gross floor area of all 
buildings within the site to the site area. See the HLEP for the 
definition of gross floor area.

Development involving or adjoining heritage items should have 
regard to Part 9 Heritage of this DCP. Sensitive interface areas are 
indicated on the Key Development Principles diagrams.

Storey controls are based on a typical commercial floor to floor 
height of 4 metres, a typical residential floor to floor height of 3 
metres and some roof projections.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | BUSINESS(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)4-62

4.5.1 Desired Future Character

East Precinct

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area. 

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development applications should demonstrate 

compatibility with the following statements of desired 
character.

The Hornsby Town Centre will be a vibrant and attractive 
place to live, shop, work and visit and provide a diversity of 
goods, services and employment opportunities.  

The Town Centre encompasses a commercial core 
surrounded by light industrial, civic/community and 
residential development of varying density.  Development 
within and adjacent to the core should provide or support 
the provision of offices and services of sub regional 
strategic significance. 

Development within the Town Centre will be consistent 
with the urban form and public domain improvements 
depicted in the Masterplan Diagram in Figure 4.5(b).  The 
design and use of buildings will incorporate active uses 
adjacent to public streets and places to contribute to the 
vibrancy of the area.  Building design will promote 
pedestrian comfort and amenity through the inclusion of 
building features that enhance a pedestrian scale at the 
base, shade and shelter, safety and security and access for 
people with a disability.  Development will improve 
physical connections across the railway line, linking the 
older, western, and newer, eastern parts of the Town 
Centre.

Buildings at gateways, arrival points or feature points will 
incorporate elements that signify the focal point of the 
Town Centre.  Avenues of street trees along the main 
vehicular and pedestrian links will enhance the visual 
quality of the area. 

The Town Centre has developed into three distinctly 
identifiable precincts, to the east and west of the Hornsby 
Transport Interchange and north of the main commercial 
precinct.  Development should be consistent with the 
individual characteristics of the precincts, as described in 
the following:

T
S

Development in the east precinct will be consistent with 
the role of much of the precinct as the commercial core, 
being the major focus of retail and commercial activity 
within Hornsby Shire and the sub regional area.

Building design will provide a pedestrian scale at the base 
and incorporate a podium.  Upper levels will be set back to 
maximise solar access to the public domain and reduce 
the impact of the building bulk on the streetscape.

The lower levels of buildings on the southern side of 
Burdett Street should incorporate active uses such as 
cafes, outdoor dining and other retail activities to identify 
the entrance to the retail core.

Buildings located adjacent to the Florence and Hunter 
Street Mall will integrate with the Mall.  The Town Square 
at the junction of Florence and Hunter Streets provides a 
focal point for the public domain.  Development adjacent to 
and within the Town Square should facilitate this role by 
the provision of seats, shade and performance areas such 
as steps and terraces.  Ground floor uses fronting the Town 
Square include outdoor dining at cafes and restaurants that 
encourage longer and more active use of the public 
domain.

North Precinct

West Side Precinct

The north precinct will provide an extension of the existing 
commercial centre and accommodate a wide range of 
living, employment and recreational activities.  

Building bulk and scale will step up from the adjacent 
residential area (to the east of Hunter Street) to the 
development along George Street.  The ground floor of 
buildings fronting Hunter Street should incorporate 
non-residential uses that activate the street frontage.  The 
lower levels of buildings fronting George Street should 
incorporate active uses such as cafes, outdoor dining and 
other retail activities.  Buildings will incorporate awnings to 
provide a pedestrian scale and to provide shelter.  High 
density residential development located above the 
commercial podium should contribute to the function of 
the Centre and maintain after hours vitality.

Development will facilitate the provision of wide tree lined

The West Side precinct is the traditional heart of Hornsby.  
The precinct will be a mixed use, street based centre that 
provides a range of housing, retail and commercial offices, 
food outlets, entertainment and employment opportunities 
to support the larger centre and service the working and 
residential populations in the area.

New buildings should reinforce the traditional shopping 
centre character of the precinct though well scaled podium 
forms, a consistent street wall height, active frontages and 
continuous awnings to primary streets that together 
contribute to the pedestrian experience. Lower levels of 
new buildings should respond to the existing fine grain 
character of the Conservation Area, using modulation to 
reduce the overall massing of a development. Tower 
elements above the street wall height should be elegant 
with slim and slender proportions and setback from the 
podium to allow view and light corridors. 

Improvements in the public domain including reconnecting 
Cenotaph Park to the precinct through a new public plaza 
that will be a gateway to Hornsby by creating a formal 
entry from the Rail Station through to the Pacific Highway, 
pedestrianising parts of Dural Lane, development of new 
lanes for vehicular access, footpath paving and widening, 
installation of bollards, provision of seating, installation of 
street furniture and traffic calming measures.  

Development along the Peats Ferry Road and Coronation 
Street should strengthen the ‘main street’ shopping and 
dining character of the precinct and should preserve high 
value heritage buildings, contributory streetscape 
elements and facades that enhance the streetscape and 
contribute to the overall sense of place of the precinct.

Strategy
Re-establish the West Side Precinct as 
the focal point of Hornsby.
Reconnect the precinct with a new plaza 
that joins Cenotaph Park, Station Street 
and Peats Ferry Road to provide a high 
quality pedestrian experience and 
gateway to Hornsby.
Provide a mix of housing and increased 
residential densities within the precinct to 
support local business and fully utilise the 
public transportation network.

Public Frontages
Activate frontages to Peats Ferry 
Road to promote and enhance the 
existing main street shopping character.
Retain existing heritage items and 
important facades.
Zero building setback to main streets at 
ground level to promote active frontages 
and create an engaging pedestrian 
experience.

Built Form
Provide a consistent street wall height 
along major streets to encourage a well 
scaled pedestrian environment.  Slim tower 
forms to be setback from the podium 
levels to reduce visual dominance.

Highest buildings to be located at 
gateway positions within the precinct. 

Built form to scale down to the 
neighbourhoods to the west.

New lanes
New lanes

Landscaping & Public Domain
Provide consistent street tree planting to 
all major streets.

Provide a new plaza to connect Hornsby 
Station & Bus Interchange to Peats 
Ferry Road and Cenotaph Park.

Utilise planters and low level landscaping 
at pedestrian crossings, corners, outdoor 
dining areas and to separate carparking 
spaces to soften the streetscape and 
guide pedestrian movements.

Pedestrianise a portion of Dural Lane to 
simplify trafﬁc movements and provide a 
safe and active connection between the 
new plaza and the neighbourhoods to the 
west.
Provide a new link across the rail line to 
better connect the east and west 
precincts of Hornsby.

Servicing
Formalise laneway system to connect 
Dural Street to William Street and the 
Council and RSL Carparks.
Where possible retain and expand 
on-street car parking along major streets.
Realign Station Street and share a 
portion of the bus interchange lanes to 
join Peats Ferry Road at a new 
intersection with High Street.
Where possible provide vehicle access to 
properties from laneways and 
underground carparking.

Desired Outcome

a. Well articulated building forms with a pedestrian-friendly 
scale that encourages commercial activity and provides 
for landscaping, open space and separation between 
buildings.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Buildings should generally have zero setbacks to 

property boundaries, except where otherwise indicated 
in the prescriptive precinct controls.

b. The following minor structures are able to encroach into 

the prescribed setbacks: 

 Driveways or basement ramps up to 6 metres wide 

with deep soil verges at least 2 metres wide adjacent 
to the side boundary, 

 Roof eaves and awnings, 

 Sunshades and screens, and

4.5.12 Public Domain and Traffic 
Management Works

Desired Outcome

a. A public domain that encourages vitality around and 

within development precincts.

b. Traffic management works that provide for the safe and 
efficient movement of vehicles to, from and within 
precincts. 

Prescriptive Measures

General 

a. Development of the public domain should make each 

precinct an attractive place that encourages 
development and provides amenity for workers, 
residents and visitors.

b. Embellishment of the public domain should include 
street furniture, new street plantings, and footpath 
improvements.

c.  Lighting for streets, parks and any other public domain 
spaces provided as part of a development should be 
energy efficient LED lighting.

Street Trees

d. Street tree planting should be provided in accordance 

with Figure 4.5(z)

e. The road approaches to the Town Centre should be 

landscaped to provide an extension of Hornsby Shire’s 
bushland quality to present a distinct change in the 
street treatment within the Central Core.

f.  Primary street tree planting should provide formal tree 
lined avenues of native evergreen species along the 
main links to the Town Centre, located along George 
Street, Edgeworth David Avenue and the Pacific 
Highway.

g. Secondary tree planting should be:

 native evergreen species on streets running north-

south, and

 deciduous tree species on streets running east-west.

4.5.13 Design Details

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes positively to the 

streetscape and the creation of a vibrant active precinct.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Buildings should be designed with external appearances 

that provide for a distinctive base, middle and a top.

b. Tower forms should appear simple yet elegant, with 

slim and slender proportions, to contribute to the overall 
skyline composition of the West Side Precinct.

c.  If a development site has more than one tower, they 
should be complementary and employ the same 
architectural design approach.

d. Tower forms must have a delineated top to visually 

terminate the building.

e. Towers should taper towards the sky to appear thinnest 

at the top.  

f.  Facades above the podium, are to engage with the 
public domain through the extensive use of large 
windows and other openings and the avoidance of large 
expanses of blank walls.

g. When commercial podiums are required, the podiums 

should have minimal gaps in the street wall and 
maintain a consistent building line.

h. A balance between horizontal and vertical elements 
should be provided through careful placement of 
windows, colour patterns and building materials. 

i.  Continuous awnings should be provided to provide 

shelter for pedestrians.  Awnings should be consistent 
with the general alignment of awnings in the street and 
the desired future character of the area. 

give  form to the intersection and provide more 
circulation space for pedestrians at the corner.

l.  Roof fixtures and lift overruns or service plants should 
be incorporated into the design of the roof to minimise 
visual intrusiveness and support an integrated building 
design.

m. Materials should relate to the context of buildings 

within the precinct to achieve continuity and harmony. 

n. Security shutters should be transparent or open grill 

design.

Active Frontages

o. The design and use of buildings should encourage 
active uses fronting public streets and places to 
contribute to the creation of a vibrant precinct.  
Entrances to buildings should be clear, well lit and well 
defined. 

p. Active and semi active frontages and awning locations 
for the West Side precinct are shown in Figure 4.5(ag)
West Side Precinct - Active Frontages and Awning 
Locations.

Wind Effects

q. A wind effects report is to be submitted with a 

development application for buildings higher than 40m. 
The report is to be prepared by a suitably qualified 
engineer and is to:

 be based on wind tunnel testing, which compares 

and analyses the current and proposed wind 
conditions;

 report the impacts of wind on the pedestrian 

environment within the site and the public domain; 
and

 provide design solutions to minimise the impact of 

wind on the public and private domain.

r.  Wind effects caused by development should not 

j.  Buildings should embody active living principles.

exceed:

k.  Corner buildings should be designed to: 

 address its neighbouring buildings, dual frontage and 

its turning of the corner, 

 step up at the corner, 

 incorporate distinctive features to enhance the 
streetscape, (such as stepped parapet turrets, 
towers, clocks etc.), and

 incorporate a splayed or square recess treatment to 

 10 metres per second for active frontages as shown 

on the Frontage Map at Figure 4.5(ag)

 16 metres per second for all other streets.

s.  New development should incorporate design features 
that will ameliorate existing adverse wind conditions.

t.  New development should minimise adverse wind 

impacts on recreation facilities and open space areas 
within development and within public domain areas.

Facades - West Precinct

Heritage Considerations - West Precinct

u. Building facades should reinforce the continuity of the 

ab. Retain or incorporate heritage buildings and high quality 

streetscape by:

v.  maintaining a generally consistent street wall height and 

podium level, 

w. incorporating a podium adjacent to the public domain 

with a height of 2 to 3 storeys (8m - 12m) in accordance 
with Figure 4.5(o),

facades where possible according to Figure 4.5(ah) 
West Side Precinct - Heritage and Facade Retention 
Plan 

Note:

See Part 9: Heritage of this DCP

Gateway Areas

x. maintaining consistent horizontal building elements and 
vertical rhythm to merge existing and heritage facades 
with new development, and

ac. The following areas represent the gateway to the Town 

Centre and require special treatment (see Figure 
4.5(ae).

y.  incorporating horizontal features that relate to the 

features on neighbouring buildings.  Where these vary, 
an infill building should relate to and create a transition 
between the two buildings.

 Peats Ferry Road adjacent to the Council Chambers 

and the TAFE College,

 Intersection of Burdett and George Streets,

 Intersection of the Pacific Highway with Edgeworth 

z.  Articulation of facades in the west precinct should relate 

David Avenue, and

to the established rhythm of the streetscape and 
incorporate appropriate vertical features such as party 
walls, projecting or recessed planes, columns, down 
pipes, changes in materials, textures or colours.

 Intersection of the Pacific Highway with Pretoria 

Parade and College Crescent.

 Cenotaph Plaza and entry to the Hornsby Rail Station 

aa. Materials should relate to the context of buildings within 

ad. Buildings on or adjacent to gateway areas should:

the precinct to achieve continuity and harmony.  
Contrasting materials may be used to provide diversity.  
However, material and colour should not dominate the 
streetscape.

Notes:

Active Frontages require 90% of the frontage to be shop and 
office windows and building entrances at street level.

Semi active Frontages require 30% of the frontage to be shop 
and office windows and building entrances at street level.

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

Horizontal features include window heads and sills, verandas, 
balconies, balustrades, parapets, changes in materials, textures or 
colours and sun hoods.

 Incorporate landmark features including a tower, or 
other vertical element or emphasis in the design, 
and/or

 Form a pair with another building to enhance the 

perception of entry.

ae. Where overhead bridges are proposed in accordance 

with the Public Domain element, the bridges should be 
designed to promote a gateway or arrival point.

Arrival Points 

af. The following areas represent arrival points within the 

Town Centre and require special treatment:

 Intersection of Peats Ferry Road with Coronation 

Street.

 Intersection of Peats Ferry Road with High Street.

 George Street adjacent to Hornsby Railway Station 

and the Florence Street Mall.

 Cenotaph Plaza 

ag. Arrival points should be identified by one or more of the 
following elements: graphics, sculpture, architecture, 
urban or landscape design elements.

ah. The pedestrian overpass into Florence Street Mall should 

be relocated to open views into the Town Square.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | BUSINESS(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)ao. The Town Centre from afar should present a cohesive 
form. Buildings should conform to the overall concept 
for the built form of the Town Centre profile.

ap. The design of taller buildings should maximise views of 

surrounding bushland as well as contribute to the 
achievement of a distinctive image for the Town Centre.

Town Centre Gateways formed by
pedestrian bridges on George Street

4-102

Feature Points

ai. Hornsby Junction at the intersection of Peats Ferry 
Road, George Street and Edgeworth David Avenue 
represents a feature point and requires special 
treatment, including the provision of distinct features 
(i.e. a landscaped medium strip, planting, paving and/or 
flag poles).

aj. The site fronting Cenotaph Plaza and Peats Ferry Road 
is in a prominent position to provide a focal point to the 
over all place making of the West Side Precinct and 
Hornsby Town Centre, by setting a positive architectural 
example and depicting the desired future character of 
the Precinct.

Views and Vistas 

ak. Development should improve or maintain views within 

the Town Centre, consistent with Figure 4.5(af).

al. Open spaces, low rise podium’s or spaces between tall 
buildings should align with the key vistas to and from 
the Town Centre depicted in Figure 4.5(af).

am. 

Development  should maintain and enhance views 

into the Florence and Hunter Street Malls

an. Where vistas are terminated by built form, such as ‘T’ 
intersections or where a change of direction occurs in 
Feature point at
the street, placing emphasis on a section of built form, 
the building should acknowledge the vista with special 
emphasis given to the axis.

4.6 Epping Town Centre

Epping Town Centre straddles the boundaries of the 
Hornsby and Parramatta local government areas.  The 
HLEP was amended by the NSW State Government in 
2014 to facilitate the Epping Urban Activation Precinct 
(UAP).  

The location of the Town Centre Core Planning Precincts is 
depicted in Figure 4.6(a) below.  The following provides 
controls for development of land which is zoned B2 Local 
Centre and located within the East and West Precincts 
within the Epping Town Centre Core.   

The Epping Town Centre Core is located around the Epping 
Railway Station and has good access to public transport.  
The Epping Town Centre Core is divided into two planning 
precincts - East Precinct and West Precinct.  

Note: 

Controls for development of land within the Epping Town Centre 
Core which is zoned R4 High Density Residential is subject to the 
applicable built form controls in Part 3 Residential of the DCP.

4.6.1 Desired Future Character

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area. 

Prescriptive Measures

b. Development applications should demonstrate 

compatibility with the following statement of desired 
character.

Epping Town Centre Core 

Epping Town Centre  is a compact and vibrant town centre 
in an important strategic location.  The town centre has 
grown and developed either side of Epping Railway Station 
and benefits from excellent rail access to most major 
employment locations in the Sydney metropolitan region 
through the main North Line, the Epping to Chatswood 
Link and the future North West Rail Link.

The Epping Town Centre Core encompasses main street 
retail/commercial activity, dispersed with civic/community 
uses and surrounded by residential development of varying 
density.  

Responsive scale and built form

Epping Town Centre will grow and develop as the retail, 
commercial, residential and cultural heart of Epping.  The 
town centre will build upon its compact character and 
increased activity will occur in the Town Centre Core, being 
areas located with good access to the rail station.  The 
majority of new residential dwellings will be developed in 
the Town Centre Core along with a range of retail, 
commercial and cultural activities at the lower levels that 
can meet the needs of the local population.

Higher density commercial, retail and residential 
development will be achieved in the form of high quality 
towers located in the Town Centre Core. New buildings 
should respond to the existing fine grain character of the 
street, using modulation to reduce the overall massing of a 
development. Tower elements should be elegant with slim 
and slender proportions and setback from the podium to 
allow view and light corridors.

Better streets and local connections

New development within the Town Centre Core will 
contribute to creating better quality streets, new and 
improved local connections, especially for pedestrians and 
cyclists and a revitalised public domain.

A finer grain structure of local connections reinforced by 

active and continuous ground level uses and clearer and 
safer connections can reinforce the role of the main 
streets as the core retail/commercial area, provide good 
pedestrian amenity and assist pedestrian safety.

Epping Town Centre’s streets will be defined and 
characterised by 2-3 storey podium development at the 
edge of the street, providing a range of easily accessible 
retail, commercial and other activities at the local level.

Improvements to local connections that can benefit the 
town centre include more effective and high quality 
pedestrian links across the railway line, new through site 
vehicular connections, better cycleway connections and 
new/improved pedestrian connections. Development will 
improve physical connections across the railway line, 
linking the western and eastern parts of the town centre.  
Avenues of street trees along the main vehicular and 
pedestrian links will enhance the visual quality of the area.  

Better spaces and places

New development within the Town Centre Core will 
contribute to creating better local parks, plazas, spaces and 
places that form part of a revitalised public domain.

Opportunities include a potential new civic space located 
on Pembroke Street to the north of Epping Branch Library.

Development along Oxford Street and other key streets 
should strengthen the ‘main street’ shopping and dining 
character of the precinct.   New buildings should reinforce 
the traditional shopping centre character of the precinct 
through well scaled podium forms, a consistent street wall 
height, active frontages and continuous awnings to 
primary and secondary streets that together contribute to 
the pedestrian experience and create a distinct character.  
Tower elements should be set back from the podium and 
be located at prominent locations to provide focal points 
and enclosure to the public realm.

Building design will provide a pedestrian scale at the base 
and incorporate a podium.  Upper levels will be setback to 
maximise solar access to the public domain and reduce 
the impact of the building bulk on the streetscape.

Epping will be a vibrant and attractive place to live, shop, 
work and visit and provide a range of goods, services and 
employment opportunities.  

The Epping Town Centre Core will continue to be 
developed into two identifiable high density mixed use 
commercial/residential areas to the south, east and west 
of the Epping Transport Interchange and a high density 
residential precinct to the south and south east.  Mixed 
use development should be consistent with the individual 

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | BUSINESS(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)4-108

characteristics of the areas as described in the following 
statements of desired character.

Epping Town Centre Core - East Precinct

The East Precinct will continue to provide traditional main 
street activities for Epping Town Centre.   The Precinct will 
provide a range of housing, retail and commercial offices, 
food outlets and entertainment and employment 
opportunities to support the larger centre and service the 
working and residential populations in the area.

Buildings within the East Precinct should reinforce the 
traditional shopping centre character of the precinct though 
well scaled podium forms, a consistent street wall height, 
active frontages and continuous awnings to primary and 
secondary streets that together contribute to the 
pedestrian experience and create a distinct character.

 The lower levels of development along Oxford Street,  and 
parts of Langston Place, Pembroke Place and Cambridge 
Street should incorporate active uses such as cafes, 
outdoor dining and other retail activities.  Development 
should strengthen the main street shopping and dining 
character of the precinct and should preserve high value 
heritage buildings and facades that enhance the 
streetscape and contribute to the over sense of place of 
the precinct.

Buildings adjacent the intersection of Langston Place, 
Pembroke Street, Oxford Street and Cambridge Place 
should incorporate architectural elements that signify the 
focal point of the town centre. 

Buildings adjacent to the proposed village green, plaza and 
library in Pembroke Place and Chambers Court should 
integrate with the adjacent public domain.  Development 
adjacent this areas should facilitate this role by the 
provision of seats, shade and performance areas such as 
steps and terraces.  Ground floor uses fronting the town 
square should include outdoor dining at cafes and 
restaurants that encourage longer and more active use of 
the public domain outside core business hours.  

Epping Town Centre Core - West Precinct

The West Precinct is a mixed use precinct separated from 
the ‘main street’ functions of the Town Centre Core by 
busy arterial roads and the railway line and station.  The 
West Precinct will support edge of centre functions and 
should provide a transition into the adjoining lower density 
residential areas.  Building bulk and scale will step down 
from Carlingford Road and Beecroft Road to the adjacent 
residential area to the north in terms of built form, scale 
and setting.

4.6.6 Design Details

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes positively to the 

streetscape and the creation of a vibrant active precinct.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Buildings should be designed with external appearances 

that provide for a distinctive base, middle and a top.

b. Tower forms should appear simple, yet elegant, with 

slim and slender proportions.

c.  Tower forms should have a delineated top to visually 

terminate the building.

d. Towers should taper towards the sky to appear thinnest 

at the top.

e. When commercial podiums are provided, the podiums 

should have minimal gaps in the street wall and 
maintain a consistent building line.

f.  Facades above the podium, are to engage with the 
public domain through the extensive use of large 
windows and other openings and the avoidance of large 
expanses of blank walls.

g. A balance between horizontal and vertical elements 
should be provided through careful placement of 
windows, colour patterns and building materials. 

k.  Materials should relate to the context of buildings within 

the precinct to achieve continuity and harmony. 

l.  Security shutters should be transparent or open 

grill design.

Active Frontages

m. The design and use of buildings should encourage 
active uses fronting public streets and places to 
contribute to the creation of a vibrant precinct.  
Entrances to buildings should be clear, well lit and 
well defined. 

n. Buildings should embody active living principles.

o. Active and semi active frontages should be provided in 
the locations nominated on the Frontage Map at Figure 
4.6(f).

p. Active frontages are to contribute to the liveliness and 

vitality of streets by:

 maximising entries or display windows to shops  and/
or food and drink premises or other uses, customer 
service areas and activities which provide pedestrian 
interest and interaction,  

 minimising fire escapes, service doors, plant and 

basement entries,

 providing elements of visual interest, such as display 
cases, or creative use of materials and architectural 
detailing where fire escapes, service doors and 
equipment hatches cannot be avoided, and 

h. Continuous awnings should be provided to provide 

 providing a high standard of finish for shop fronts.

shelter for pedestrians. Awnings should be consistent 
with the general alignment of awnings in the street and 
the desired future character of the area. 

i.  Corner buildings should be designed to: 

 address its neighbouring buildings, dual frontage and 

its turning of the corner, 

 step up at the corner, 

 incorporate distinctive features to enhance the 
streetscape, (such as stepped parapet turrets, 
towers, clocks etc.), and

 incorporate a splayed or square recess treatment to 
give  form to the intersection and provide more 
circulation space for pedestrians at the corner.

j.  Roof fixtures and lift overruns or service plants should 
be incorporated into the design of the roof to minimise 
visual intrusiveness and support an integrated 
building design.

q. Driveways and service entries are not permitted on 

active frontages, unless it is demonstrated that there is 
no alternative.

r.  Security grilles may only be fitted internally behind shop 
fronts and are to be fully retractable and at least 50% 
transparent when closed.

Notes:

Active frontages require 90% of the frontage to be shop and 
office windows and building entrances at street level.

Semi active frontages require 30% of the frontage to be shop 
and office windows and building entrances at street level.

on the Frontage Map at Figure 4.6(f).

 16 metres per second for all other streets.

 maintaining consistent building heights, 

 maintaining consistent horizontal and vertical lines, 

x. New development should incorporate design features 
that will ameliorate existing adverse wind conditions.

and

 incorporating horizontal features that relate to the 
features on neighbouring buildings. Where these 
vary, an infill building should relate to and create a 
transition between the two buildings.

y.  New development should minimise adverse wind 

impacts effects on recreation faculties and open space 
areas within development and within public domain 
areas.

t.  Materials should relate to the context of buildings within 

Reflectivity 

the precinct to achieve continuity and harmony.  
Contrasting materials should be used to provide 
diversity.  However, material and colour should not 
dominate the streetscape.

z.   A Reflectivity Report that analyses potential solar glare 
from the proposed building design may be required for 
taller buildings.

aa. Generally, light reflectivity from building materials used 

u. Building materials and features may include:

on facades should not exceed 20%.

 parapets incorporating decorative brickwork or render, 

ac. External lighting should not disturb the amenity of 

and

 cantilevered steel, suspended awnings.

Notes:

residents in the locality.

ad. External lighting should minimise the light spill into the 

night sky.

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

Horizontal features include window heads and sills, verandas, 
balconies, balustrades, parapets, changes in materials, textures or 
colours and sun hoods.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | INDUSTRIAL(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)5-3

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to land within the industrial 
areas of Hornsby Shire. The industrial areas are located in 
Thornleigh, Mount Kuring-gai, Hornsby Heights, Asquith/
Hornsby and Dural Service Centre and includes land within 
the following zones: IN1 General Industrial and IN2 
Light Industrial.

The planning controls for the industrial areas are informed 
by the Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Subregional Employment 
Study (2008) and the Dural Service Centre Retail and 
Commercial Study (2009).

Hornsby Shire’s industrial land is competitively placed to 
attract industrial activity. Development in industrial areas 
will incorporate a range of employment generating land 
uses such as industry, transport related uses, warehousing 
and distribution.  The industrial areas will also incorporate 
land uses that provide services to meet the day to day 
needs of workers in the area.  Other land uses that are 
typically located in business centres, such as retail and 
offices, are to be limited within the industrial areas to 
reinforce the commercial centres hierarchy and ensure the 
most efficient use of infrastructure.

Development is to be sited and designed to be 
environmentally sustainable, minimise land use conflicts 
and operate under appropriate environmental management 
measures to manage waste and minimise air, water and 
noise pollution.  Development will also be compatible with 
the scale, form, design, colour, height, materials, setbacks 
and landscaping of the surrounding area, in particular 
sensitive areas.

Certain Land in Mount Kuring-gai and Asquith/Hornsby

k.  In addition to the above controls, certain industrial land 
in Mount Kuring-gai and Asquith/Hornsby has been 
identified as potentially containing significant flora and 
fauna habitats, as identified in Figures 5.1(b) and 5.1(c) 
of this DCP. The siting of buildings and ancillary facilities 
should protect any significant flora and fauna habitats.

Notes:

Landscaped area means a part of a site used for growing plants, 
grasses and trees, but does not include any building, structure or 
hard paved area.

Sensitive areas include any adjoining residential lands, 
community uses, educational uses, public open spaces and 
recreational areas.

The applicant is encouraged to incorporate species from Council’s 
publication Indigenous Plants for the Bushland Shire available at 
Council’s website hornsby.nsw.gov.au as part of the development.

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to all land within the Hornsby 
Local Government Area and provides specific controls for 
the subdivision of land.  

The planning controls are informed by the NSW Housing 
Code, the Hornsby Shire Housing Strategy (2010), and the 
Hornsby Shire Rural Lands Planning Provisions (2009).

The Hornsby Shire Housing Strategy identified areas 
suitable for the provision of additional housing to assist 
meet Council’s housing obligations into the future.  A 
concentrated housing model has been adopted, with 
housing located in planned precincts rather than dispersed.  

Subdivision of land is to be designed to ensure development 
relates to site conditions, is consistent with the existing or 
desired future character of the area, is located in areas 
where services and related infrastructure are available and 
protects the natural and built environment.  

Note that environmental controls relating to subdivision 
applications are also provided in Part 1 ‘General’ of the DCP.

d. At least 50 percent of the minimum landscaped area 

should be located behind the building line to the primary 
road frontage.

e. A proportion of the front yard should be maintained as 

landscaped area as follows:

 25 percent of the front yard for lots less than 

18 metres wide, and

 50 percent of the front yard for lots greater than 

18 metres wide.

Note:  

Landscaped area refers to a permeable area capable of growing 
plants, grasses and trees.  It does not include the 200m2 building 
envelope, the principle private open space area, clothes drying 
areas, driveways, and other structures or hard paved areas. 

Lot size (or site area) in relation to development, means the 
area of the lot to which an application for consent to carry out the 
development relates, excluding:

(a) any land on which the development is not permitted under an 
environmental planning instrument, and

(b) if a lot is a battle-axe or other lot with an access handle, the 
minimum lot size excludes the area of the access handle.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | SUBDIVISION(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)6.3 Rural Subdivision

6.3.1 Rural Lands Subdivision

The following provides controls for subdivision in the Rural 
areas of Hornsby Shire, including land within the following 
zones: RU1 Primary Production, RU2 Rural Landscape, 
RU4 Primary Production Small Lots, E2 Environmental 
Conservation and E3 Environmental Management.

Desired Outcomes

a. Subdivision density that maintains the character of the 

area and is consistent with the zone objectives. 

b. Subdivision design that provides setbacks to 

developable areas that will:

 provide sufficient boundary setbacks to maintain the 

open rural character of the area; 

 protect landscape features, and

 minimise potential landuse conflicts with existing 

rural activities.

Prescriptive Measures

Lot Size

c.  The minimum allotment size for land within the rural 

areas of the Shire shall be in accordance with the HLEP 
Minimum Lot Size map as summarised in Table 6.3(a).

carriageway or the like is to be excluded.

e. Some lots in the rural area have a split zoning, such as a 
rural zone (eg RU2) and an Environmental Protection 
Zone (eg E3). Subdivision of such land is to ensure that:  

 The total area of each new lot is equal to or greater 
than the minimum rural zone lot size over land; and

 Includes a component of rural zoned land equal to or 

greater than 20% of the minimum lot size.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | SUBDIVISION(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)6-10

f.  In addition, subdivision layout should generally provide 

Setbacks

for equal sized split zone lots with regular division lines.  
Such a layout would promote orderly subdivision where 
the burden of managing the environmentally sensitive 
land (eg. E3 zoned land) is shared amongst a number of 
property owners, as illustrated in Figure 6.3(a), and in 
accordance with Clause 4.1B of the HLEP.

p. Council may grant consent for a subdivision upon land 

zoned RU1 Primary Production, RU2 Rural Landscape or 
RU4 Rural Small Holdings which is less than the 
minimum allotment size requirement as shown on the 
Lot Size Map contained in HLEP, where it can be 
demonstrated that the purpose of the subdivision is for 
primary production purposes only.

q. The following additional provisions relate to applications 

for primary production lots:

 Any lot created for the purpose of primary production 
only is to demonstrate that the land is of suffient size 
and shape to accommodate viable primary production 
use. 

 All applications should be accompanied by a letter 
from NSW Department of Primary Industries or 
financial documentation certifying that the agricultural 
activity on the allotment justifies the demand for a 
separate lot.

r.  Any proposed lot for primary production purposes must 
not be created so as to permit an existing dwelling to be 
situated on the lot.

s.  A dwelling-house or dwelling (including a rural workers 
dwelling) is prohibited to be erected on any primary 
production lot.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | COMMUNITY (THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)7-3

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to all land within the Hornsby 
Local Government Area and provides specific controls for 
community related landuses including: child care centres, 
schools, places of worship, community housing, 
telecommunications, temporary community events, and 
health services facilities (in the SP2 zone).

The planning controls for child care centres are informed 
by the Hornsby Child Care Planning Review (2006). 
Restrictions on the number of child care places in 
individual developments, building height, size and bulk are 
the primary tools that Council have applied to limit the 
potential impact on residential amenity. However the 
controls permit larger centres where there is an additional 
community benefit, such as the inclusion of nursery places 
for 0-2 year olds and other children’s services

Development is to be sited and designed to be 
environmentally sustainable, minimise land use conflicts 
and operate under appropriate environmental management 
measures to manage waste and minimise air, water and 
noise pollution. Development should be compatible with 
the existing or desired future character of the area. 

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | COMMUNITY(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)7-4

7.1 Community Uses

The following section provides guidelines for the 
development of land for community uses including child 
care centres, schools and places of public worship 
throughout Hornsby Shire.

7.1.1 Site Requirements

Desired Outcomes

Major Roads and Rail Corridors

d. Community uses adjoining a major road or railway 

should be accompanied by a report that demonstrates 
the site is suitable for use in terms of acoustic amenity.

e. Community uses adjoining a major road are to include 
siting and design measures to ameliorate the potential 
impact of vehicle emissions on the site.  

a. Community Uses with a site area that contributes to the 

achievement of desired urban design outcomes.

Note:

b. Community Uses located to be readily accessible to 
users,  promote the health and safety of the future 
occupants of the facility and minimise potential land use 
conflicts.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. The development site width of a school should not be 
less than 60 metres in urban areas, measured at the 
primary street frontage.

b. The development site width of a place of worship in a 

residential area should be less than 50 metres, 
measured at the primary street frontage.

c.  Community uses should not be situated on:

See further details on Noise and Air quality controls refer to Part 1 
of the DCP.  

Separation from Intensive, Offensive or Hazardous 
Landuses

f.  Community uses should not be sited in close proximity 
to significant noise, dust or odour generating uses.

g. Within the rural areas of the Shire, community facilities 
should comply with the minimum separations between 
intensive rural landuses and sensitive landuses as 
detailed in Section 2.2 of the DCP.

h. Community uses in industrial areas should not be 

located within 100 metres of dangerous goods of a 
quantity requiring a notification to Workcover NSW, as 
measured from the location of the dangerous good to 
the nearest point of the site.

 battle-axe allotments, or

 in a street, or portion of a street, ending in 

Notes:

a cul-de-sac.

Note:

Preferred locations for the establishment of community uses 
include:

 corner sites, sites adjacent to non residential uses, sites 

with frontage to a park, and

 walking distance (i.e. 400m) to public transport facilities, 
local shopping facilities, schools, or other community 
facilities, and

Workcover notification for the storage of dangerous goods is 
covered by the OHS Regulation 2001, Explosives Act 2003 
and the Radiation Control Act 1990.  Applicants should contact 
Workcover’s Dangerous Goods Licensing Unit on (02) 4321-5500 
to apply for necessary site search/s for details on notifications 
received on dangerous goods.

The NSW Fire Brigade’s operational guidelines require that in the 
event of a leak, spill or similar emergency, a 100m exclusion zone 
in all directions around the hazard may be established.

Contaminated Land

that is potentially contaminated.

Notes:

SEPP 55 Remediation of Land contains procedures for 
proponents of development on contaminated sites.

State Environmental Planning Policy (Educational Establishments 
and Child Care Facilities) 2017 (the SEPP) commenced on 1 
September 2017 and established a new planning framework 
for child care and school development which includes some 
requirements which differ from Council policy. Accordingly, Part 
7.1 of the HDCP should be read in conjunction with the SEPP.

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to land within the River 
Settlements of Hornsby Shire as indicated on Figure 8(a).  
The River Settlements are located along the Hawkesbury 
River (i.e. Milsons Passage, Dangar Island and parts of 
Brooklyn) and along Berowra Creek between Marra Marra 
Creek and Berowra Waters. 

The planning controls for the River Settlements are 
informed by the Hornsby Shire River Settlements and 
Foreshores Review (2007).

Development within the River Settlements will be 
ecologically sustainable and will protect water quality, 
significant native flora and fauna, the natural topography 
and the scenic quality of the area.  The disposal of effluent 
and grey water from buildings will be in a manner 
acceptable by Council that will not impact on water quality 
or downstream properties and waterway users (i.e. 
commercial and recreational fishers, swimmers, boaters). 

Housing within the River Settlements will be consistent 
with the desired character and recognise the access, 
environmental and infrastructure constraints of the area. 
The population within the River Settlements will be restricted 
to levels which will not impact on the natural environment. 

Commercial facilities will service the local residential 
population and the regional population who utilise the area for 
recreation and will recognise the access, infrastructure, and 
environmental constraints of the area. Tourism and tourist 
infrastructure will protect the natural resources that serve to 
attract tourists and the social environment of the area. 

Community services and facilities will be provided in 
accordance with existing and future population thresholds 
and community preferences.

Dangar Island

Dangar Island is a unique bushland island settlement, 
essentially free of vehicular traffic, predominantly 
residential in use. Topography divides the island into 2 
distinct parts - an open flatter more urban part and a 
steeply sloping bushland area. Dwellings in the flatter 
more open part of the site are 1 and 2 storeys in height.  
Development on the steeper bushland are of pole design 
with decks and undercrofts clinging to the hillside. 

Fishermans Point

Fishermans Point remains an isolated settlement.  
Dwellings are set on large lots surrounded by bushland.  
Development is setback from the river and not readily 
viewed from the water.

Marra Marra Creek

Marra Marra Creek is an isolated river settlement set 
amongst the mangroves. The remoteness of the area 
reinforces the sparseness of development. New dwellings 
are single storey of modest design with a fibro or 
weatherboard appearance and pitched roofs.

Milsons Passage

Milsons Passage continues to be a relatively remote 
weekender style residential settlement. New dwellings are 
typically single storey elevated above the river level, with 
boat sheds, jetties and ramps lining the foreshore. Some 
new development on steeper land takes the form of pole 
homes with a fibro or weatherboard appearance and 
pitched roofs.

Neverfail Bay

Neverfail Bay retains a range of dwelling types. Traditional 1 
and 2 storey development of weatherboard and fibro 
appearance with modest low pitched roofs are built on 
lower, more level areas. Elevated slopes incorporate pole 
homes with bushland settings. Native vegetation is retained 
to assist screen buildings and reduce overall scale.

Sunny Corner

Sunny Corner remains an isolated settlement. Dwellings 
are single storey either hugging the level river banks or 
setback in the bushland. Dwellings are screened by 
indigenous vegetation. 

8.1 River Settlement Land

The following section provides controls for the 
development of land zoned E3 Environmental 
Management, E4 Environmental Living, IN4 Working 
Waterfront and SP3 Tourist (Brooklyn).

8.1.1 Desired Future Character

Desired Outcome

a. Development that contributes to the desired future 

character of the area.

Prescriptive Measures

b. Development applications should demonstrate 
compatibility with the following statements of 
desired character:

Berowra Waters

Berowra Waters is dominated by the operations of the 
ferry crossing, commercial marinas and associated 
buildings on either side of the river. New development is 
sympathetic to the existing bushland and landscape 
setting. Dwellings are a mix of 1 and 2 storeys in height 
and respond to the natural topography. The scale of new 
development has a village atmosphere. 

Brooklyn

Brooklyn continues to play a vital role in the maritime 
operations of the river, providing a transport interchange, 
maritime services facilities, commercial fishing, and a 
gateway for tourists, visitors and residents of the 
Hawkesbury River.  Redevelopment of the foreshore area 
prioritises the retention of vegetation such as mangroves. 
Dwellings are a mix of 1 and 2 storey dwellings, with pole 
design homes stepping up the hillside on the southern 
side of Brooklyn Road.

Calabash Point

Calabash Point consists mainly of shallow building 
platforms terraced along the water’s edge at the base of 
the escarpment. The topography of the area dictates that 
new houses are sited according to the natural landform, 
with pole design for steeper sites. New dwellings are 
generally 2 storeys in height. The water’s edge retains the 
natural landform and limits the inclusion of urban 
elements, such as seawalls and swimming pools. 

Coba Point

Coba Point has a mix of 1 and 2 storey dwellings nestled in 
the bushland along the foreshore. New dwellings take 
advantage of the sweeping views available north up the 
river, while blending in with the surrounding landscape.  
Roofs are low pitched or flat.

Notes: 

and

Floor area of a dwelling house includes carports, garages, 
balconies, patios, pergolas, terraces or verandahs which are 
attached to the house and have two enclosing walls of at least 1.4 
metres above floor level. The calculation of floor area is the total 
of both the ground and upper floors (if there is  one) not including 
awnings, eaves, voids, stairways or lift shafts.

As detailed in Clause 4.5 of the HLEP the Floor Space Ratio 
of buildings on a site is the ratio of the gross floor area of all 
buildings within the site to the site area.  See the HLEP for the 
definition of Gross Floor Area.

Lot size (or site area) in relation to development, means the 
area of the lot to which an application for consent to carry out the 
development relates, excluding:

(a) any land on which the development is not permitted under an 
environmental planning instrument, and

(b) if a lot is a battle-axe or other lot with an access handle, the 
minimum lot size excludes the area of the access handle.

 be stepped in design with single storey on the 

waterfront and the 2 storey component towards 
the rear.

d. Any part of a building within 5 metres of the Mean High 

Water Mark (MHWM) should be single storey.

Notes: 

Building height (or height of building) means the vertical 
distance between ground level (existing) and the highest point 
of the building, including plant and lift overruns, but excluding 
communication devices, antennae, satellite dishes, masts, 
flagpoles, chimneys, flues and the like.

Storey means a space within a building that is situated between 
one floor and the floor level next above, or if no floor above, the 
ceiling or roof above, but does not include:

(a) a space that contains only a lift shaft, stairway or meter room, 
or

(b) a mezzanine, or

(c) an attic.

Mean high water mark means the position where the plane of 
the mean high water level of all ordinary local high tides intersects 
the foreshore, being 1.44m above the zero of Fort Denison Tide 
Gauge and 0.515m Australian Height Datum.

8.1.4 Landscaping

Desired Outcomes

Stairs and Inclinators

e. Stairs and inclinators should:

a. Landscaping which screens building undercroft areas.

 on steep sites be constructed to sit above the natural 

b. Landscaping that retains the natural landscape features 

of the riverine scenic areas.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Setback areas should be landscaped and designed to:

 retain indigenous bushland and landscape features as 

prescribed in Part 1 of this DCP, 

 retain indigenous trees and comply with AS 4970, 

 incorporate the planting of indigenous species rather 

than lawns, and

 not be terraced or contain retaining walls unless it is 
demonstrated necessary to achieve a high quality 
built outcome or to reduce erosion. Where retaining 
walls or terracing is proposed, rough stone, natural 
timber or other natural materials which blend with the 
landscape should be used. Such work should not 
disturb remnant bushland, particularly on the 
foreshore. 

Fencing

b. To maintain the riverine scenic quality of the area and 
facilitate the sharing of views, fences should not be 
constructed between the building and the water. Visual 
separation between dwellings should be achieved 
through landscape planting.

c.  Fencing is discouraged along Riverview Avenue, to 

maintain the Island’s bushland character.

d. Where required, fences should be constructed from 

lightweight materials and dark neutral tones. Colorbond 
fencing is discouraged. 

Note:

Applicants are encouraged to incorporate species from Council’s 
publication Indigenous Plants for the Bushland Shire available at 
Council’s website hornsby.nsw.gov.au as part of the development.  

ground line and not be formed by terracing the 
natural topography (see Figure 8.1(i)),

 be constructed from lightweight elements such as 
timber or steel with no solid masonry or concrete 
(see Figure 8.1(j), and

 be painted in dark neutral tones.

f.  Inclinators should also:

 be kept to a minimum length and the inclinator rail 
should be kept as close as possible to the natural 
ground level, 

 avoid being adjacent to the windows and private 

outdoor areas of buildings on adjoining properties, 

 avoid a motor that is audible from within the nearest 
habitable room of any adjacent premises (windows 
open), and

 avoid glare and light spill.

Figure 8.1(i): New access stairways should not cut into the 
landform. This approach disrupts indigenous vegetation and 
watercourses and increases the risk of soil erosion.(I)

Figure 8.1(j): New access stairways should have minimal 
disruption to the landform. They should be lightweight and 
constructed from steel or timber.(I)

privacy screen if:

waterways are shared.

Prescriptive Measures

General

 it is a window to a habitable room, other than a 

bedroom, that has a floor level of more than 1 metre 
above existing ground level, 

 the window is setback less than 3 metres from a side 

a. Development should allow for the reasonable sharing of

significant views, including water views and iconic 
views, in particular:

 views that have not already been obscured,

 views from front and rear boundaries whilst in a 

standing position, and

 views from living and entertainment areas 

(including kitchens).

 the window has a sill height of less than 1.5 metres. 

e. Decks and the like that need to be located more than 

600 millimetres above existing ground level should not 
face a window of another habitable room, balcony or 
private open space of another dwelling located within 
9 metres of the proposed deck unless 
appropriately screened.

b. Development should allow for the reasonable sharing of

Note:

Views from private dwellings considered in development 
assessment are those available to an observer standing 1 metre 
from a window or balcony edge (less if the balcony is 1 metre or 
less in depth).

 new landscaping comprising a light open foliage, and

 incorporating the design details in Section 8.1.8.

Note: 

View Sharing - Consistent with Planning Principles endorsed 
by the Land and Environment Court, where an impact on 
views arises as a result of non-compliance with one or more 
planning controls, even a moderate impact may be considered 
unreasonable.  Whereas, with a complying proposal, the question 
should be asked whether a more skilful design could provide the 
applicant with the same development potential and amenity and 
reduce the impact on the views of neighbours.  If the answer 
to that question is no, then the view impact of a complying 
development would probably be considered acceptable and the 
view sharing reasonable.  For planning principles on view sharing 
refer to case Tenacity Consulting v Warringah Council [2004] 
NSWLEC 140 available on the NSW Land and Environment Court 
website at www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au.

8.1.8 Design Details

Desired Outcomes

a. Building design that complements the desired character 

of the River Settlements.

c.  Commercial buildings should be designed to: 

 provide active commercial ground-floor uses that are 
at the same general level as the public footpath and 
are accessible directly from the public domain,

 provide frontages on upper levels that facilitate 

b. Building design that is sympathetic to the topography of 

passive surveillance of the street, 

the site and limits large substructure areas that are 
visible from the waterway and public areas.

c.  Development that incorporates environmentally 

sustainable design and construction.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Development should be designed to:

 be consistent with the desired character of the area 
and dominant design themes within the immediate 
area, including roof pitch, materials, colours, textures 
and window placement, 

 address all river and street frontages, 

 have a maximum cut and fill of 1 metre from existing 

ground level, 

 distinguish between the commercial and any 

residential component of the development in terms 
of building entries and private, communal and public 
open space, 

 identify a safe, clear and direct pedestrian entrance to 

the building from the primary street frontage, 

 incorporate awnings that relate to the architecture of 
the facade and provide for continuous shelter for 
pedestrians, and

 embody active living principles.

Materials and Colours (E3 and E4 Zones)

d. Buildings should be of lightweight timber and steel 
construction with a weatherboard and fibro cement 
appearance and corrugated iron roofing.

e. Solid masonry, brick or stone buildings and terracotta or 

 retain public access to the foreshore, 

slate roofing is discouraged.

 maintain existing commuter berthing facilities, and

f.  Louvred windows are encouraged.

 ensure minimum impact on the waterways water 

quality and downstream users.

b. Dwelling houses should be designed to: 

 incorporate pole or pier construction methods on 

steeply sloping sites,

 limit the visual impact of large undercrofts that are 

visible from the waterway and public areas, 

 be sited on the lower foot slopes of allotments in the 

River Settlements rather than on ridge lines, and

 reduce the perceived building bulk by avoiding large 
unbroken roof planes, and incorporate lightweight 
features to articulate the facade, such as verandahs, 
decks, awnings and screens.

g. Buildings should be painted in dark, neutral tones.  

Primary colours should not be used.

h. Bright or light colours (excluding white) should only be 

used in small areas of buildings as highlights.

Notes: 

Building design should have regard to the scenic quality 
requirements of Sydney Regional Environmental Plan No. 20 
which encourages small unobtrusive buildings and landscaping 
to screen and break up building appearance. It also precludes 
seawalls and the construction of fences to the waterfront.

To achieve active living principles development should have regard 
to NSW Health’s Healthy Urban Development Checklist and the 
National Heart Foundation’s Blueprint for an Active Australia.

more than 1.5 metres above existing ground level should 
not be enclosed.

n. Any undercrofts below a height of 1.5 metres which are 
enclosed should be constructed of timber battens with 
a minimum 50 percent openings as illustrated in 
Figure 8.1(o)

o. Undercrofts, including any plumbing or rainwater 
tanks located within, should be painted in dark 
recessive colours.

8.2 River Settlement Uses

The following section provides controls for ancillary uses 
and works in the River Settlements.

8.2.1 Boat Sheds

Desired Outcomes

a. Boat sheds which are modest in scale and only used for 
the storage and routine maintenance of boats and other 
maritime goods.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Boat sheds should be designed and located to:

Building Facades and Roof Forms

c.  Boat sheds should be constructed of lightweight 
materials, preferably of timber and weatherboard 
appearance in nautical colours (whites, creams, 
greys and blues). Solid masonry or stone boat sheds 
are discouraged.

d. Boat sheds should have a maximum glazed component 
of 30 percent in the facade adjacent to the waterway.

e. Openings onto the waterway should be large enough to 

facilitate the movement of boats but not consist of 
sliding glass doors or bi-folding doors.

f.  Boat shed roofs should be gabled with a roof pitch of 

 be sited above the MHWM, 

approximately 30 degrees.

 be single storey with a maximum height of 3.6 

Notes: 

metres to the ridgeline, 

 have a maximum floor area of 30m2, and

 the frontage of the boat shed (facing the water) 

should not be more than half the depth of the shed 
(see Figure 8.2(a)).

b. Boat sheds should not contain any services not 

associated with maritime activities, including kitchens, 
living areas, bedrooms or any other living facilities.

Boat shed means a building or other structure used for the 
storage and routine maintenance of a boat or boats and that is 
associated with a private dwelling or non-profit organisation, and 
includes any skid used in connection with the building or other 
structure.

Boat shed design should incorporate best management practices 
and accommodate materials for the containment, collection and 
off site disposal of products associated with boat maintenance. 

For further information on management practices for boat shed 
operators refer to the Department of Environment and Climate 
Change (DECC) Environmental action for marinas, boat sheds 
and slipways (June 2007) guide on the Office of Environment and 
Heritage website at www.environment.nsw.gov.au.

8.2.2 Water Recreation Structures

Desired Outcomes

g. Where more than 2 permanent berths for boats of 8 

metres length or greater are proposed, boat pumpout 
facilities should be provided.

a. Piers, wharves, jetties and boat launching ramps that 
are compatible with the built and natural elements of 
the area.

b. Piers, wharves, jetties and boat launching ramps that

maintain water flow and navigation channels.

i.  The length of a waterway structure should not exceed 

c.  Piers, wharves, jetties and boat launching ramps that 
are  located to provide safe, convenient and equitable 
access to the waterway.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Waterway structures should be constructed using 
floating pontoons or pier construction methods to 
maximise the free flow of water beneath recreation 
structures. Wharves and jetties should not be 
constructed of solid fill.

the distance required to reach minimum navigable water 
depth (i.e. 600 millimetres at Indian Spring Low Water 
tide).

j.  Despite the above, a waterway structure may be 

constructed to a length that does not exceed the length 
of any existing waterway structure on the adjoining 
property.

k.  The length of a waterway structure should not adversely 

impact on aquatic and visual environments and/or 
obstruct navigation and commercial fisheries 
operational areas.

b. Elevated platforms or boardwalks are discouraged.  
Where required, platforms or boardwalks should not 
extend beyond the MHWM.

l.  Berthing facilities such as pontoons and wharves should 

be shared where possible by 2, or more, adjoining 
properties, with legal shared access rights.

m. Where a berthing facility cannot be built at a property, 

1 off-shore residential mooring will be permitted.

Note: 

Water recreation structure means a structure used primarily 
for recreational purposes that has a direct structural connection 
between the shore and the waterway, and may include a pier, 
wharf, jetty or boat launching ramp.

For further information on protecting aquatic habitats refer to the 
Fish Habitat Protection Plans on the NSW Department of Primary 
Industries website at www.dpi.nsw.gov.au. 

c.  To ensure safe charter, a detailed hydrographic survey 

should be submitted to demonstrate a minimum water 
depth of 600 millimetres at Indian Spring Low Water 
tide between the head of the waterway structure and 
recognised navigation channels.

d. Waterway structures should be located in areas away 

from aquatic plants including seagrass beds and 
saltmarshes and retain mangroves.

e. Where it is demonstrated that aquatic plants cannot be 
avoided, mitigation measures should be employed. For 
example, wharves and jetties should incorporate 
translucent or mesh walkways and pontoons to allow 
sunlight penetration. 

f.  The location and length of waterway structures should 
be restricted to the limits illustrated in Figures 8.2(b) to 
8.2(d) where appropriate to:

 conserve public access to recreational assets, such 

as beaches, 

 maintain safe navigable channels, 

 maintain the visual amenity of the waterway, and

 minimise impacts on the foreshore, aquatic and 

sensitive natural environments.

8.2.3 Seawalls 

Desired Outcomes

a. Seawalls constructed only in circumstances where it is 

necessary to protect improvements on properties.

b. Seawalls that provide habitats for marine flora 

and fauna.

(cid:19)(cid:20)

Design

f.  Seawalls should reflect a slope that is commensurate 
with the surrounding natural landscape and should 
minimise wave reflection to prevent the transfer of bed 
and bank instability onto adjacent properties.  Vertical 
walls have the greatest reflectance and should not be 
(cid:19)(cid:21)
built (see Figure 8.2(e)).

c.  Seawalls that complement the landscape features of the 

natural riverine scenic area.

g. New seawalls should take account of the levels and 
layout of adjoining sites and achieve integration 
between adjoining sites (see Figure 8.2(f)).

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. To maintain the riverine scenic quality of the area, 

seawalls are discouraged where alternative options such 
as bank stabilisation with vegetation is available.

b. Seawalls should not be used as part of any reclamation 
of the foreshore area.  Material should not be dredged 
from the estuary for the purpose of providing material to 
backfill a seawall.

Location

c.  Seawalls should be located entirely within private 

property boundaries.  Seawalls (including the ‘toe’) 
should not extend below the MHWM without written 
authority from the relevant Crown authority.

d. Seawalls should not impede any public right of access.

e. Seawalls should not affect the tidal flushing patterns of 

the estuary.

Note: 

Development applications for seawalls should be accompanied 
by a report by an appropriately qualified person that addresses 
existing tidal patterns. 

Consideration should be given to the Environmentally friendly 
seawall guidelines by the Department of Environment and 
Climate Change NSW.

h. Seawalls should be no higher than is necessary to

Materials and Landscaping

j.  Seawalls should be constructed of permeable materials 
such as sandstone and not mortar, solid masonry or 
poured in-situ concrete. Mortar should only be used for 
the addition of ecological features (such as ecological 
pools and horizontal shelves) (see Figure 8.2(g)).

k.  Seawalls should not restrict planting of riparian 
vegetation or impede the potential for estuarine 
vegetation to recolonise. Incorporation of estuarine 
vegetation, such as seagrasses, mangroves and 
saltmarshes into seawall design is encouraged.

Figure 8.2(g) Seawalls should be constructed from rough 
sandstone blocks.  The nature of the material reduces the 
wash, provides a habitat for marine flora and fauna while 
presenting a more natural shoreline.(I)

8.2.4 Tourist and Visitor Accommodation 

Short-Term Rental Accommodation

These controls apply to Bed and Breakfast Accommodation 
and Short-Term Rental Accommodation (comprising 

short-term holiday letting of dwelling-houses).

Desired Outcome

a. Tourist and visitor accommodation that is compatible in 
scale and character with development in the locality.

b. Tourist and visitor accommodation that provides 

adequate facilities and services for occupants and are 
located and designed to minimise amenity impacts on 
the locality.

Prescriptive Measures

General

h. Short-term rental accommodation should:

 be undertaken in a lawful dwelling, 

 be on a short-term basis (less than 90 days), and

 comprise a maximum of 6 guests.

i.  A Code of Conduct to be signed and adhered to by 
guests should be prepared and submitted with the 
development application. The Code of Conduct should, 
at minimum, address the following responsibilities of 
guests during their stay:

 maximum guest numbers, 

 contact number of the property manager including an 

after hours number,

 noise and lighting restrictions for activities 

c.  A single sign should be displayed in public view within 

after 10pm, 

the property boundaries that:

 has a maximum area of 0.5m2, 

 includes details of the land use, name(s) of the 

owner/establishment and 24 hour contact phone 
number, and 

 should not be illuminated.

d. In unsewered areas, it should be demonstrated that the 
existing sewage management system is adequate for 
the proposed use or will be upgraded. 

e. Active recreation facilities, such as barbeque areas, 
should be located away from the bedroom areas of 
adjoining dwellings.

f.  If relevant, a bushfire evacuation plan should be 

submitted with the development application showing 
means of evacuation in an emergency. The bushfire 
evacuation plan should be displayed within the dwelling 
or sleeping rooms.

Bed and Breakfast Accommodation

g. Bed and breakfast accommodation should:

 be undertaken by the permanent residents of the 

dwelling-house, 

 be on a short-term basis, and

 comprise a maximum of 3 bedrooms catering for a 

maximum of 6 guests. 

 instructions concerning recycling, garbage services 
and special requirements relating to the disposal of 
garbage, and

 procedures in case of an emergency.

Notes:

The change of use of a dwelling to tourist and visitor 
accommodation may require a change of classification under the 
Building Code of Australia (BCA). This may require significant fire 
upgrading work and disabled access provision to the building.

Bed and breakfast accommodation means an existing dwelling 
in which temporary or short-term accommodation is provided on 
a commercial basis by the permanent residents of the dwelling 
and where:

(a) meals are provided for guests only, and 

(b) cooking facilities for the preparation of meals are not provided 
within guests’ rooms, and 

(c) dormitory-style accommodation is not provided.

Short-term rental accommodation differs from bed and breakfast 
accommodation in that visitors of the latter are hosted by the 
permanent residents of the dwelling where the former has no on-
site manager. It is otherwise known as short-term holiday letting.

Proponents of tourist and visitor accommodation should have 
regard to the Guidelines for Bed and Breakfast Operations 
available on the Local Government and Shires Associations of 
NSW website at www.lgsa.org.au.

For further information on preparing a Holiday Rental Code 
of Conduct, refer to the best practice publication Holiday 
Rental Code of Conduct - Version 1 (March 2012) available at

Kangaroo Point Masterplan

Interpretation

a. Development should be consistent with the urban 

design guidelines provided in the Masterplan diagram 
and incorporate the following elements:

Former Restaurant Building

b. Any new building or adaptation of the existing building 
should be constructed on the footprint of the existing 
former restaurant building. The building should be a 
maximum of two storeys in height and vehicular access 
should be provided to both upper and lower levels.

c.  The building should include public toilets and other 

use/s that are compatible with and encourage visitation 
for recreation, such as:

 Commercially operated café / restaurant;

 Council managed heritage interpretation facility;

 Take-away food facility;

 Community lecture rooms;

 Public barbeque facilities with shade and shelter;

 Caretaker’s residence up to a maximum of 100m2 

floor space and external curtilage up to a maximum 
of 50m2  and/or

 Storage for management of the reserve.

d. The building should be constructed with a structural 

system that will be appropriate in providing flexibility for 
future uses, such as a columned frame. Building 
materials should be natural materials such as timber and 
low-reflective metal cladding to ensure the building is 
not visually intrusive. Pitched roofs should be articulated 
into a number of planes to visually fragment the bulk of 
the building. Wide eaves are desirable to ensure walls 
are shaded. This should ensure visual recessiveness and 
energy efficiency in the building.

Disused Sheds

e. The disused sheds and carport on the southern side of 
the road leading to the public wharf should be removed 
to open up views of the mangrove area.  

f.  The disused sheds on the land spit may be used for the 
provision of office and storage space for recreation 
based activities.

g. Signage boards should be provided for school and 
educational groups and for visitors wanting an 
introduction to the site. Interpretation sites should be 
provided on main walking paths to provide recreational 
users with an understanding of the site through more 
abstract signage and sculpture.

Existing Stone Walling and Edges

h. Existing stone walls and edges should be retained and 
restored as significant remnants of early European 
development of the area.

Paths

i.  An accessible walking circuit should be provided that 

extends to all site features, including the mangrove area, 
stone walls, main building, public wharf, picnic areas, 
playground, car parks and foreshore. This should provide 
easy access to all facilities on-site.

Picnic Areas

j.  Grass picnic areas should be provided on upper and 

lower terraces in areas of existing shade where views to 
waterway are prominent. Grass species should be used 
which minimise weed invasion into natural areas.

k.  Furniture should be of robust materials such as steel 

and concrete on bins and barbeques and warm 
materials such as timber on seats.

l.  Electric barbeques should be sited near or, if the use of 
the building for commercial purposes is demonstrated 
to be unviable, in the former restaurant building.  

m. Seating and benches should be dispersed to all 

picnic areas.

n. Garbage bins should be centrally located. This should 

minimise waste and centralise rubbish 
collection activities.

Playground

o. Playground equipment should be provided for children. 

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | RIVER SETTLEMENTS(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 30 NOVEMBER 2016)8-34

Roads

Commercial Houseboat Marina

y.  The existing houseboat berths and associated offices 

within the “Luxury Afloat” marina should be 
reconfigured to be contained within the boundaries of 
the commercial licence issued by the Land and Property 
Management Authority (LPMA).

Commuter Berthing Facility

z.  To protect seagrass, maintain boat channels and retain 
views to and from the water, any commuter berthing 
facility should be: 

 limited to a maximum of 25 boats of up to 6 metres 

in length; and 

 within the area shown on the Masterplan or an 

approved licence area.

Public Wharf Upgrade and Use

aa. Public vehicular and pedestrian access to the wharf 

should be retained.

ab. Commercial operators should be provided access 

where development consent for the use has 
been granted.

ac. The existing timber framed ferry wharf should be 
retained. A light weight framed wharf should be 
provided to provide improved access for potential users 
(i.e. charter ferries). Any new wharf should conserve 
built fabric identified as having heritage significance and 
the scale, materials and colours of any structure should 
not be visually intrusive.  

ad. Three short term berthing spaces should be included 

on the pontoon of any proposed upgrade of the 
public wharf.

p. Existing roads should be reused as vehicular access. In 
some instances they can be narrowed. One way roads 
should be sealed 4 metres wide. Two way roads should 
be 7 metres wide. Road edges should be soft 
landscape. Bollard and wire rope should be used to 
prevent errant vehicle parking. Road edges should be 
cambered into natural swales to filter roadway 
contaminants and sediment from entering waterway. 

Coach Parking

q. Parallel coach parking should be provided on the 

upper level.  

r.  A lease should be issued over the coach parking bays to 
a co-operative of commercial charter boat operators.  
The use of the coach parking bays between public and 
private interests should be balanced.  

Car Parking

s.  Car parking should be provided at both upper and lower 
levels and formalised by line marking. Three car parking 
spaces should be designed for use by disabled persons.

Lighting and Signage 

t.  Lighting should be sufficient for night time use of paths 
that link car park areas to wharfs. Suitably designed pole 
top lights should be provided on 6 metre poles to 
minimise spread.

u. Signage should be minimised and low-key. 

No advertising on the site should be permitted.  

Vegetation

v.  Mixed species in existing vegetation is significant to the 
heritage of the place. Existing vegetation should be 
conserved to maintain shade opportunities.

w. New shade planting should be provided to enhance the 
opportunities for shade on the site. Tree species should 
include endemic tree species and understorey planting 
should include native grasses. Native screen planting 
should be provided to screen unsightly activities such as 
Telstra building and the Freeway. Mangrove areas should 
be reinstated.  

Caretaker’s Residence

x. The caretaker’s residence on the lower level of the 

former restaurant building should be retained for use by 
a person undertaking the role of a caretaker of 
Kangaroo Point.

Introduction

This Part of the DCP applies to Aboriginal cultural heritage, 
listed heritage items, heritage conservation areas and 
places in the vicinity of heritage items and heritage 
conservation areas.

Heritage includes places and objects that have a sense of 
living history, and which offer physical links that connect 
the community to earlier generations and their way of life. 
The Dharug and Guringai Aboriginal people were the 
original owners of Hornsby Shire. Significant remnants of 
Aboriginal culture remain within the Shire as evidence of 
their occupation. 

Conserving heritage helps us to understand our past and 
contribute to the future. Hornsby Shire’s heritage illustrates 
prominent themes of development including transport, 
horticulture, country estates and subdivision. The heritage 
resources encompass a diverse range of buildings, 
structures, places and landscape elements.

The provision of guidelines addressing design, 
streetscapes, sitting, garages, carports, fences, gates and 
landscaping will assist in conserving the heritage 
significance of the natural and built environment and 
ensure new development is sympathetic with identified 
heritage values. In doing this, the Shires’s heritage 
resources and the quality of the environment will be 
maintained or improved, resulting in attractive streetscapes 
and provding an appealing place to live.

Heritage controls will not prevent development, rather 
ensure that change takes place in a way that does not 
detract from the significance of heritage items.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | HERITAGE(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019)9-4

9.1 Heritage Administration

9.1.1  Development Without Consent

e. Replacing original materials with modern materials 

which are not of a similar style, type, colour and profile 
is not minor work and will require development consent.

f.  Repainting surfaces, other than items on the State 
Heritage Register, may not require development 
consent. Colours should be in keeping with the heritage 
significance or style of the property or heritage 
conservation area.

g. Painting previously unpainted surfaces requires 

development consent from Council.

Notes: 

Clause 5.10(3) of the HLEP states that development consent 
is not required for other specified forms of development not 
identified in this DCP.

Some minor developments are permissible on heritage items and 
within heritage conservation areas as exempt development under 
the provisions of State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt 
and Complying Development Codes) 2008, including access 
ramps, air-conditioning units, pathways and paving, playground 
equipment and rainwater tanks. For further information go to 
www.planning.nsw.gov.au

HLEP Clause 5.10 provides controls for heritage 
conservation including when development consent is 
required.  The following supplements the provisions in 
Clause 5.10(3).

General

a. Pursuant to Clause 5.10(3) of the HLEP, Development 
consent may not be required for work to a Heritage 
Item or Heritage Conservation Area if Council is 
satisfied that the proposed development:

 is of a minor nature, or is for the maintenance of the 
heritage item, archaeological site, or a building, work, 
relic, tree or place within a heritage conservation 
area; and

 would not adversely affect the significance of the 
heritage item, archaeological site or heritage 
conservation area.

b. Contact Council’s Planning Division to determine 

whether development consent is required. Written 
advice from Council should be obtained prior to 
commencement of works.

Maintenance and minor works

c.  For the purposes of Clause 5.10(3) of the HLEP, and 

subject to the provisions of this section, the following 
minor maintenance works may not require consent: 

 resealing/treating timber;

 replacing broken windows;

 re-hanging doors or gates;

 replacing or establishing gutters and down pipes;

 re-pointing brickwork;

 restoring posts or fence posts;

 repairing stonework and plaster work;

 underpinning and damp proofing; and

 general maintenance of heritage gardens (pruning or 

replanting original species).

d. Replacing external materials such as roofs or exterior 
cladding with like materials may be considered minor 
work. However details of such proposed works should 
be submitted to Council, seeking confirmation in writing 
that development consent is not required.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | HERITAGE(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019)9-5

9.1.2 Development Application 

Submission Requirements 

HLEP Clause 5.10(5) and 5.10(6) identifies when a heritage 
impact statement, heritage conservation management 
plan or other heritage management document is required 
to be considered prior to granting development consent.  
The following supplements the provisions in Clause 5.10.

Heritage Items 

a. Development applications for heritage items normally 

require:

 Heritage Impact Statement; and

 measured drawings of the existing building 

including elevations.

b. Conservation Management Plans (CMPs) are required 
for changes to State significant heritage items and 
development applications that rely on the conservation 
incentive provisions of Clause 5.10(10) of the HLEP. A 
CMP usually includes:

 a statement of heritage significance;

 a history of the place;

 a physical description of the place including buildings, 

site features and landscaping;

 a description of the constraints and opportunities 

affecting the heritage item; and

 conservation policy recommendations.

c.  A heritage conservation management plan should 

accompany a development application that proposes a 
change of use to a purpose that would otherwise not be 
permissible but for Clause 5.10(10) of the HLEP. The plan 
should demonstrate:

9.2 Heritage Items

This section applies to Heritage Items listed in Part 1 of 
Schedule 5 Environmental Heritage of the HLEP. Heritage 
Items include buildings, works, gardens and trees.

Prescriptive Measures

General

9.2.1 General Design Requirements 

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that allows reasonable change to occur to 

heritage items, particularly to meet contemporary 
amenity or safety standards without unreasonably 
impacting heritage significance.

b. Alterations and additions that are sympathetic to 
significant features, and do not dominate the 
heritage item in terms of bulk, scale, form, setbacks 
and materials.

c.  Development that encourages new uses that facilitate 

the ongoing viability of heritage items without adversely 
affecting heritage significance.

d. New uses that allow for interpretation of the heritage 
item and do not result in substantial or irreversible 
changes to significant features.

a. Features or elements that contribute to the heritage 

significance of the item should be retained.

b. Council does not generally support demolition of 
heritage items. Poor structural condition or costs 
associated with renovating are not 
sufficient justifications.

c.  New work and changes should be located away from 

main areas that are intact or highly significant. 

d. New buildings, structures, landscaping or other works 
should be located to minimise adverse impacts on the 
setting of the heritage item.

e. Introducing decorative elements that could reduce the 
integrity and confuse the period of the building should 
be avoided,  unless documentary or physical evidence 
exists to show it has been removed.

f.  For large projects a staging plan may be required to 

indicate when secondary or non-heritage works are to 
be undertaken.

g. Servicing, fire safety or BCA compliance upgrades for a 
new use should not impact on the heritage significance 
of the item.

Removing unsympathetic changes

h. Unsympathetic elements should be removed, especially 
where substantial changes are proposed to a heritage item 
and the reversal will assist an improved heritage outcome.

and length than the existing building. (i)

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | HERITAGE(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019) 
9-7

Form, massing and scale

i.  New work should be designed to complement the 
heritage item in terms of scale, proportion, bulk, 
massing and detail. 

j.  Additions and extensions at the front of heritage items 
should be avoided. Additions should be located away 
from the principal elevation and significant features of 
the heritage item, and behind and below the main 
roof ridge.

k.  Alterations and additions should be smaller in scale and 

length than the existing building.

l.  Large second storey additions should be avoided. 
Additions should be located to the rear or side. 
Depending on the form and style of the building it may 
be possible to design new levels within the existing roof 
space or below the gutter line of the main building.  

m. Extensive blank or unarticulated walls are discouraged. 

Articulation should be achieved through the use of 
materials or design elements such as soldier/string 
courses, windows, fibro/timber inserts or the like.

Internal changes

n. Changes to the original layout of the building should 
be minimal so that the evolution of the building 
remains recognisable. Development should retain 
significant interior elements. For example, wall nibs, 
decorative ceilings, picture rails, architraves, feature 
tiling or features such as fire places should be retained.

Materials, colours, finishes

o. Rendering or painting original face brick is 

not supported. 

p. Materials should be selected to complement the period 

and style of the building. Compatible, but not 
necessarily matching materials i.e. modern materials, 
may be used where appropriate.

Note: 

The controls for heritage items adopt a “whole of building” 
approach because heritage significance applies to the whole 
property, not just the front façade of a building or particular 
element of a site. The controls are based on the principles of 
minimising impact on heritage significance, and ensuring that 
where change occurs, the decision is based on an understanding 
of heritage significance.

9.2.2 Garages, Carports and Driveways

9.2.3 Gardens, Trees and Landscaping

Desired Outcomes

Desired Outcomes

a. Garages and carports that do not dominate heritage 
items in terms of design, bulk, scale and setbacks.

a. Development that retains and conserves significant 

garden elements, trees and landscaping.

Prescriptive Measures

Garages and carports

b. Gardens that complement the heritage significance and 

architectural style of the heritage item.

a. Garages and carports should be located at the rear of 

the property.

Prescriptive Measures

Gardens

b. A garage or carport may be considered adjacent to the 

a. Heritage listed gardens should retain layouts and 

building where access to the rear is not available, 
provided it is setback behind the building line and is 
designed to complement the architectural style of the 
heritage item.

c.  Altering or demolishing any part of the heritage item to 
enable construction of a garage or carport should be 
avoided, except where the topography or building 
design allows for the change and the modification will 
not alter a primary or intact section of the building.

Driveways

primary features and structures.

b. Trees and garden elements which contribute to the 

significance of a heritage listed item should be retained 
and conserved.

c.  Gardens within the curtilage of a heritage listed item 

should be designed to complement the period and style 
of the item.

d. Alterations and additions should be located to avoid 

impacts on significant trees and garden areas.

d. Existing driveways constructed as two wheel strip or 

Trees and landscaping

traditional driveway form should be retained.

e. Driveways should be designed to minimise extent and 

visual dominance. Materials that complement the period 
of the dwelling should be used.

Note:

Parking structures and areas can have a significant impact on the 
integrity and setting of heritage items. Open areas or carports are 
generally preferable than garages. Double fronted garages can be 
intrusive and should generally be avoided.

e. The removal of trees that are identified as heritage 
items or are within the curtilage of heritage items 
should be avoided unless the tree is diseased, dying or 
dangerous.

f.  Mature trees that are removed should be replaced with 
a tree in a similar or more appropriate location that will 
mature to similar size and canopy.

g. Proposed works should comply with AS 4970 Protection 

of Trees on Development Sites.

h. All tree pruning work should be carried out in 

accordance with AS 4373 Pruning of Amenity Trees.

i.  Site works, including driveways, should be located and 

designed to avoid damage to significant trees.

j.  Connectivity of large street trees with adjoining or 

nearby remnant groups should be protected.

Note:

When the removal of significant trees are proposed, a landscape 
plan should be provided detailing the replacement trees.

Works involving heritage listed trees should also have regard to 
Part 1 General of this DCP.

Figure 9.2(c): Typical fences and gates. (C)

Prescriptive Measures

Fences and gates

a. Original fences and gates should be retained. Where 

sections of fence are required to be replaced because of 
poor condition, sections of the old fence in good 
condition should be integrated where possible.

b. Location of gates should be retained where the 

associated path and garden are part of a traditional 
garden layout and are historic links between the 
property and the street.

c.  Fences and gates should complement the period and 
style of the building as indicated in Figure 9.2 (c).

d. Traditional fencing materials should be used such as 

timber, iron, brick and stone. Sheet metal and tubular 
steel fences should be avoided.

Fences on busy roads

e. High, solid fences should be avoided other than 

on-sites along roads with significant traffic volumes. 
In these instances:

 fences should be a maximum height of 1.8 metre;

 piers should be a maximum height of 2 metres and 

where the fence is to be broken up, a maximum of 3 
metres apart; and

 fences should incorporate articulation.

Note:

Council may require the fence to be setback at least 600mm 
from the property boundary to allow hedge planting to soften the 
appearance in the streetscape.

Roads with significant traffic volumes include: Pacific Highway 
(south of Edgeworth David Avenue); Pennant Hills Road; 
Carlingford Road; Beecroft Road; Epping Road; Castle Hill Road; 
Boundary Road; and New Line Road.

9.2.5 Subdivision

Desired Outcomes

a. Subdivision that retains adequate curtilage, and protects 

the setting of heritage items.

b. Subdivision that enables historical boundaries to 

be interpreted.

c.  Subdivision that supports the ongoing use of the 

heritage item.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Adequate area around the heritage item should be 

retained to facilitate its ongoing use, or allow for flexible 
adaptive reuse in a manner compatible with its history 
and heritage significance.

b. Subdivision should minimise interference with the visual 

setting of the heritage item. The lot containing the 
heritage item should have sufficient area to provide a 
visual setting that is proportional to the size and design 
of the building.

c.  Changes affecting significant gardens should 

be avoided.

d. Potential impacts from associated development (such as 

extensive driveways or hard stand areas) on the 
heritage significance and setting of the heritage item 
should be minimised.

e. Traditional relationships between the heritage item 
and street, such as traditional presentation of the 
heritage item, should be retained particularly where 
the relationship to the street is part of its 
heritage significance.

f.  The subdivision layout should enable historic boundaries 
to be interpreted. This may be achieved by the location 
of internal subdivision lines along historic fence lines 
or similar.

g. A Conservation Management Plan may be required 

depending on the scale of the site and scope of works.

h. A staging plan should confirm that conservation works 
will occur prior to the issue of a subdivision certificate.

9.2.6 Rural Heritage Items

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that protects the physical and visual 

setting of rural heritage items.

e. The matters below should be addressed where an 

application is on the site of, or adjoins, a rural 
heritage item:

 the historic subdivision pattern associated with 

the item;

b. Dwellings that support modern living arrangements 

 topographic features such as tree lines, fences or 

whilst retaining the significance of small heritage listed 
cottages.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development should minimise adverse impacts on the 

historic and visual curtilage for the heritage item.

b. Development on land adjoining a rural heritage item 

should be of an appropriate scale, taking into 
consideration the visual relationship between the 
development site and the heritage item and need 
for screening.

c.  The setting of the heritage item should be 

maintained through design, siting of works and 
landscaping as appropriate.

d. Alterations and additions to small heritage listed cottages 

should be in the form of pavilion type extensions.

creeks that form natural lines of division;

 stands of vegetation (natural bush or regenerated 
areas) that could be impacted by development;

 view corridors to, or from the heritage item; 

 building scale adjoining the item;

 building materials, new fencing and new landscaping;

 screening measures that may be needed if the new 

development is much larger in scale than the heritage 
item; and

 elements depicted in Figure 9.2(e).

9.2.7 Commercial Heritage Items

d. Infilling of original verandahs should be avoided.

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that retains evidence, including layout, of 

original shopfronts.

b. Development that reinstates traditional features and 

results in sympathetic new work.

c.  Development that contains minimal signage that 

complements, rather than dominates, the architectural 
characteristics of the building.

Prescriptive Measures

Facade treatment

a. Original elements and features, including features above 

awning level, should be retained.

b. Replacement shopfronts, where original shopfronts 
have been altered, should be based on historic 
information and/or interpretation of period details.

e. Colour schemes for repainting should be based on 

historical evidence or period colour charts.

Signs

f.  Signs should be located on parts of the building that 
have traditionally been used for signs. Above awning 
signs should  be avoided except where part of the 
original design.

g. The number and location of signs on commercial 

buildings should be sympathetic to the character and 
style of the building.

Detailed Fabric Survey (Epping Town Centre Core) 

h. Where works are proposed to heritage items, Council 

encourages and may require a detailed fabric survey for 
significant  heritage items to identify original significant 
fabric and internal elements that should be retained and 
conserved.

c.  New work should respect the form, scale and detailing 

Hornsby West Side

of the existing building, and streetscape features 
including the parapet line.

Figure 9.2(f) - Elements of a traditional early twentieth century 
shop front. (I)

i.  When works are proposed, Council encourages and 
may require a detailed fabric survey for significant 
heritage items to identify original significant fabric and 
internal elements that should be retained and 
conserved.

j.  The following buildings appear to be relatively intact and 

should be retained and conserved:

 Pair of Federation Shops - No. 3 Jersey Street

 The Browsery Cottage - No. 5 Jersey Street

 Hornsby Cinema - No. 155 Pacific Highway

 Shop - No. 187 Pacific Highway.

Notes:

Hornsby’s commercial heritage items are predominantly from 
the Federation period, and include a grouping along the Pacific 
Highway in the west precinct of the town centre. Other 
heritage listed commercial buildings are at Epping, Waitara and 
at Brooklyn.

While some shopfronts have been altered, most of Hornsby’s 
commercial heritage retains period detailing above awning level. 
Important considerations for future proposals are sympathetic 
signs, colour schemes and façade treatments.

This Section provides general controls that apply to all 
Heritage Conservation Areas (namely 9.3.1 to 9.3.5) and 
detailed additonal controls where appropriate for 
specific Heritage Conservation Areas (within the 
Character Statements).

The particular characteristics that make each Heritage 
Conservation Area significant are described in the 
Character Statements in this section, including a plan of 
the Heritage Conservation. For most areas this includes 
the history of subdivision, main building periods and 
associated architectural styles, consistency of buildings in 
terms of form, height, setbacks and materials, landscape, 
trees and the streetscape elements.

Development in Heritage Conservation Areas is required to 
respect the significant characteristics of the area. The 
controls place emphasis on how changes appear from 
public spaces, and ‘fit in’ in relation to the predominant 
built form, style and landscape character of the area.

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | HERITAGE(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019)9-14

9.3.1 General Design Provisions

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that complements and is sympathetic to 
the existing character of the conservation area and the 
elements that are significant to that character.

Prescriptive Measures

Maintain and reinforce characteristic details

a. Development should respect the significant 

characteristics of the Heritage Conservation Area, 
as detailed in the applicable Character Statement in 
this Part.

b. Significant changes to front elevations should be avoided 
where the existing building retains characteristic detailing.

c.  Original decorative elements and detailing on buildings 
should be used where appropriate but should not be 
overdone as a means of fitting in.

Form, massing, scale, setbacks – streetscape character

d. New work should be designed to complement the 

existing streetscape in terms of the following elements 
(refer to Character Statements for details):

e. Additions should be located away from the street 

elevation and below the main ridge line.

f.  New buildings, alterations and additions should be 

single storey within streetscapes that are predominately 
single storey. New levels, or split level additions, may be 
possible to the rear on sloping sites.

g. Ancillary structures e.g swimming pools, tennis courts, 

sheds, should be located in rear yards.

h. New buildings should be located so that they are 

compatible with predominant front setbacks in the 
street, particularly the setbacks of immediately 
adjoining buildings.

i.  Roof form and pitch should be compatible with 

characteristic roof forms of the conservation area. 
Traditionally rear extensions used skillion or simple 
pitched roof forms.

Contemporary design

j.  Contemporary design should be sympathetic to 
the characteristic built form of the conservation 
area, particularly in terms of bulk, scale, height, 
form or materials.

 Building elements - scale, height, bulk, massing, roof 
form, orientation, façade treatments, setbacks and 
spaces between buildings, verandah and window 
placement, balance of solid walls and openings, 
materials, colours and textures; and

 Landscape elements – landscaping and gardens, 

height and design of fences, garages, driveways and 
existing street trees.

Materials and finishes

k.  Rendering or painting over original face brick should 

be avoided.

l.  Materials used should complement the period and style 
of the building, and the conservation area. Compatible, 
but not necessarily matching materials i.e. modern 
materials may be used where appropriate (refer to 
Character Statements for details).

9.3.2 Garages, Carports and Driveways

Driveways

f.  Existing driveways constructed as two wheel strips 

should be retained. 

g. New driveways should be constructed as two wheel 

strips where characteristic of the conservation area or 
appropriate to the site context.

h. The number of driveways to the street and extent of 
paved area from each property should be minimised. 
Turning circles should be avoided.

i.  Alternatives to concrete such as brick edging, 

paving, bitumen/asphalt, gravel or grass-crete should 
be considered.

Notes: 

Garages can be intrusive where they are allowed to dominate 
front facades. They were traditionally located to the rear of houses 
or designed as secondary elements. 

Paving associated with driveways can significantly impact the 
streetscape character of conservation areas, especially 
where there is a strong link between the landscape and 
heritage significance.

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that retains the integrity and setting of 

heritage conservation areas. 

b. Garages and carports that are designed as secondary 
structures and do not dominate the streetscape of 
heritage conservation areas. 

Prescriptive Measures

Garages and carports

a. Garages and carports should be located to the rear of 

the property. 

b. A garage or carport may be considered adjacent to the 

building where access to the rear is not available, 
provided it is setback behind the building line and to the 
side of the dwelling.

c.  Garages and carports should not dominate the street 

elevation or main façade of the building, and should be 
designed to:

 be consistent with the Character Statements;

 complement the existing dwelling in terms of design 

and materials;

 present as secondary to the dwelling;

 avoid double garages visible from the street; and 

 preferably comprise open sided carports rather than 

solid, enclosed structures. 

d. The alteration or demolition of any part of a building to 
enable construction of a carport or garage should be 
avoided, except where topography or the building 
design allows for the change.

e. A maximum of one hardstand parking space should be 
located within the front setback area. Landscaping and 
garden layout should complement any hardstand area.

b. Landscaping that retains original and traditional garden 

layouts and plantings.

c.  Fencing that complements the streetscape character 
and the significance of the heritage conservation area.

Prescriptive Measures

Gardens

a. Traditional garden settings should be retained, 

particularly where they are important to the character of 
the heritage conservation area.

b. New gardens should be horticulturally and stylistically 
sympathetic to the period of the heritage conservation 
area with the use of similar materials.

c.  Alterations and additions should be located to avoid  

impacts on significant trees and garden areas.

sections of fence are required to be replaced because of 
poor condition, good sections of the old fence should be 
integrated where possible.

i.  Location of gates should be retained where the path 

and garden are part of a traditional garden layout and are 
historic links between the property and the street.

j.  Fences and gates should complement the period and 

style of the building and the streetscape.

k.  Traditional fencing materials should be used such as 

timber, iron, brick and stone. Sheet metal and tubular 
steel fences should be avoided.

850 -  1100mm

Picket fence 1880-1920 (typical height 850 - 110mm)

d. Development should not impact upon trees/landscaping 

850 -  1100mm

that contribute to the significance of the heritage 
conservation area including the removal of trees/
landscaping that contribute to the significance of the 
heritage conservation area. 

e. Mature trees/landscaping that are removed should be 
replaced with trees/landscaping in a similar or more 
appropriate location that will mature to similar size and 
canopy.

f.  Proposed works should comply with AS 4970 Protection 
of Trees on Development Sites.  All tree pruning work 
should be carried out in accordance with AS 4373 
Pruning of Amenity Trees.

Works involving significant trees within heritage conservation 
areas should also have regard to Part 1 General of this DCP. 

Trees, gardens and landscape elements define the public/private 
domain and are often critical to the cohesive sense of place in 
conservation areas. Landscape elements can also help to ‘soften’ 
developments that might otherwise be intrusive.

Fences and gates are important streetscape elements because of 
their proximity to the street edge and role in defining the public/
private domain.

9.3.4 Demolition

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that does not detract from the qualities of 
the Heritage Conservation Area and which are positive 
elements in the streetscape.

Prescriptive Measures

General

a. Demolition of buildings that are characteristic of the 
heritage conservation area and are intact, or easily 
capable of having characteristic details reinstated, 
should be avoided (refer to Character Statements 
for details).

b. Demolition of a building that is compatible with the 

characteristic built form as described in the Character 
Statement, should only be considered where it is not 
reasonable to alter and extend to meet contemporary 
amenity and living standards.

c.  Replacement buildings and associated landscaping 

elements should be sympathetic to the characteristic 
features of the Heritage Conservation Area.

Note:

Heritage Conservation Areas rely on the combined effect of a 
range of contributing elements to retain their significance. While 
demolition of one building may seem minor, the broader effect on 
the area’s character can be substantial.

Where demolition is proposed the assessment is based on the 
heritage significance of the property rather than the development 
potential of the land.

Fences on busy roads

l.  High, solid fences should be avoided other than on-sites 
along major roads with significant traffic volumes. In 
these instances fences should be:

 a maximum height of 1.8 metres;

 piers should be a maximum height of 2 metres and 

where the fence is to be broken up, a maximum of 3 
metres apart; and

 fences should incorporate articulation.

Note: 

Council may require the fence to be setback at least 600mm 
from the property boundary to allow hedge planting to soften the 
appearance in the streetscape.

Roads with significant traffic volumes include: Pacific Highway 
(south of Edgeworth David Avenue); Pennant Hills Road; 
Carlingford Road; Beecroft Road; Epping Road; Castle Hill Road; 
Boundary Road; and New Line Road.

9.3.5 Subdivision

Desired Outcomes

a. Subdivision that retains characteristic subdivision 

patterns, particularly where the subdivision pattern is 
closely related to characteristic built patterns in the 
heritage conservation area.

b. Subdivision that prevents intrusive developments as 

a result of uncharacteristic changes to the 
subdivision pattern.

Prescriptive Measures

a. Altering the subdivision pattern (either by amalgamating 
or subdividing lots) should be avoided, especially where 
the characteristic development pattern is based on lots 
of consistent size often supporting similar building types 
(refer to the Character Statement for details).

b. New lots should be capable of development that is 
compatible with the established character of the 
heritage conservation area, especially in terms of the 
orientation of buildings and setbacks.

c.  Subdivision should not result in new dwellings being 
constructed in the front setback area of existing 
characteristic buildings.

d. Potential impacts from associated development such as 
driveways and hard stand areas on the streetscape and 
heritage significance of the heritage conservation area 
should be minimised.

e. Changes affecting significant gardens should 

be avoided.

Note: 

The subdivision pattern often underpins the heritage significance 
of heritage conservation areas. Changes to the subdivision pattern 
can result in unsympathetic developments where the new lots are 
not compatible with the characteristic lot pattern of the area.

9.3.6 Beecroft—Cheltenham Heritage 

Conservation Area—Character 
Statement

h. Mature trees, including remnant forest trees, combine 
to create a landscaped character. The gardens and 
private domain plantings contribute to this character.

The location of the Beecroft-Cheltenham Heritage 
Conservation Area and the Precinct boundaries is depicted 
in Figure 9.3(e).

History

a. The Beecroft-Cheltenham Heritage Conservation Area 

comprises the Field of Mars Common, a Crown 
subdivision released over a number of years from 1887. 
The area’s development followed completion of the 
Main North railway line to Hornsby in 1886.

Description

a. The topography has been a dominant influence on the 
area’s development, determining the location of the 
railway line, influencing the road layout and restricting 
development into the deep gullies.

b. Subdivision and infill development have been part of the 

pattern of development. The area retains its 
predominant character as an area of single dwellings.

Beecroft Village Precinct (Commercial Centre)

i.  The Beecroft Village is within the land of the first Crown 
subdivision. The first general store, Stobo’s store opened 
in 1893. The Beecroft School of Arts opened in 1904 after 
years of agitation by the Beecroft Progress Association.

j.  A second general store, chemist and a land agent opened 
in 1905. From 1910 the centre began to take shape, and 
by 1915 there were 15 retail businesses in the area.

k.  The village centre has a variety of building designs and 

setbacks. The historic growth of the centre along 
Wongala Crescent, Beecroft Road and later Hannah 
Street is evident by the smaller individual buildings 
that remain.

l.  The Beecroft School of Arts, Fire Station and Village 

Green create a strong gateway to the centre, and are 
important to the heritage character and fabric of the 
centre. The Village Green represents a community 
landscape of local significance.

Beecroft-Cheltenham Plateau Precinct

Beecroft North Precinct

c.  The Beecroft-Cheltenham plateau extends either side of 

m. The land between Chapman Avenue, Albert Road and 

the railway line and Beecroft Road. The plateau 
incorporates the early release subdivisions of the 
Field of Mars which saw development extend in a spine 
on the more level and accessible land along the 
transport corridors.

Pennant Hills Road remained semi rural until the 
Inter-war period, with orchards still present in the early 
1960s. Some earlier houses occur along Beecroft Road. 
The original building on the Mount St Benedict’s School 
grounds dates from 1907.

d. The early development occurred near Beecroft Station 
from the late 1880s, comprising villas with modest and 
large domestic gardens that have become 
characteristic of the area’s streetscape. Development 
around Cheltenham Station commenced in the 1920s 
on later subdivisions.

e. Victorian villas are among the earliest remaining 

buildings in Beecroft and Cheltenham. The main building 
periods are Federation, Edwardian and Interwar, with 
infill development from later periods also present in 
most areas.

f.  Buildings are predominantly single storey in scale, and 
are well articulated in the manner characteristic of 
the period. 

n. The undulating topography results in steep roads and 
terraced sites. Exposed rock outcrops are common in 
the area. The subdivision pattern includes cul-de-sac 
roads, with irregular setback patterns. Fencing is 
generally open.

The Northern Triangle Precinct

o. The triangle on the northern side of Pennant Hills Road 

is an area of more recent development. This area 
remained semi rural until the Inter-war period, with 
orchards still present in the early 1960s.

p. The undulating landscape has an irregular subdivision 

pattern with varying lot sizes. 

q. Large Federation houses are located along Pennant Hills 

g. Stone foundations, face brick with rendered detailing of 
small areas and terracotta or slate tiled roofs are typical.

Road and Boundary Road, and at the southern end 
towards Chapman Avenue.

r.  The remnant forest canopy is important to the 

area’s character.

The Gullies Precinct

Prescriptive Measures

s.  Development of the gullies and less accessible edges of 
the Field of Mars Common occurred from the 1960s. The 
eastern edge of the Common is still clearly discernible.

t.  The land is typically sloping and includes bluffs and 
rock outcrops, with some original and regrowth 
forest communities. 

a. Development within the Beecroft-Cheltenham Heritage 
Conservation Area should be in accordance with the 
general controls within Part 9.3 and the additional 
prescriptive measures in Table 9.3.6(a).

v.  Development is mostly from the post war and modern 
periods in a mix of single and two storey built form.

w. Landscaping and mature trees are prominent in the 
streetscape. Front gardens are often open without 
fences, or with low fences constructed in stone 
or freestone.

Statement of Significance

a. The Beecroft-Cheltenham Heritage Conservation Area is 
significant as an example of a government subdivision 
that was used to fund the development of a railway line. 
The area developed from 1893 as a township due to its 
proximity to Beecroft Station.

b. The Heritage Conservation Area demonstrates a 
multi-layered history of suburban subdivision, 
re-subdivision and development from the initial boom 
period of the Victorian crown land subdivision of 1887 to 
the 1960s, and less noticeably into the present day.

c.  The area contains a fine collection of buildings from the 
Victorian, Federation, Arts and Crafts, Inter-War and 
Post-War eras. There have been comparatively few 
demolitions to interrupt the “development diary”, 
resulting in generally intact early residential fabric 
and streetscapes.

d. The Beecroft Village Precinct contains an important 

public reserve and community buildings including the 
Beecroft School of Arts and the Beecroft War Memorial 
that represent the aspiration of a growing suburb. The 
continuing focus in the Beecroft village for day to day 
activities and community interaction, together with the 
community buildings, clubs and activities show an 
enduring sense of community cohesiveness.

9.3.7 Hornsby West Side Heritage 

Description

Conservation Areas–Character 
Statement

The location of the Hornsby West Side Heritage 
Conservation Areas and the Precinct boundaries is 
depicted in Figure 9.3(f).

History

a. The Mt Errington Precinct was initially subdivided in two 
sections – between Frederick Street and Lisgar Road in 
1886, west of Lisgar Road in 1897. The Pretoria Parade 
Precinct comprises small lot Edwardian and Post War 
subdivision development. Peat’s Ferry Road was 
established by George Peat for his own private access.  
The government adopted it as an official route and 
improved it for traffic in 1850. This is more or less the route 
of the present Pacific Highway from Pearce’s Corner.  
The Pacific Highway name was adopted in 1931.

a. Topography is a major influence in the Heritage 

Conservation Area. Grass verges, concrete footpaths and 
low street planting are common elements. Driveways are 
typically of single width and garages are set to the rear of 
houses or behind the main building line.

Peat Ferry Road (Pacific Highway) Precinct

b. The Peat Ferry Road Precinct includes the old Hornsby 
town centre, and the civic and open space uses to the 
north.

c.  The Precinct is within the West Precinct of the Hornsby 

CBD, and includes a number of individually listed 
heritage items along the Pacific Highway and Jersey 
Street.

d. The Precinct contains one of the few surviving 

streetscapes of Federation and Inter War period 
commercial buildings in Hornsby.

e. The group of buildings within Coronation Street/Jersey 
Street form the earliest shopping precinct in Hornsby, 
dating from 1894. Development along the Pacific 
Highway dates from c1901.

f.  Shopfronts are generally two or three storeys with 

parapeted facades and suspended awnings facing the 
streetscape.

hipped and gabled roofs, and verandahs to the front.

p. Houses in Nursery Street are single and two storey with 
hipped and gabled roofs, and verandahs to the street. 
The buildings are set to the higher ground with smaller 
setbacks to the east. Side setbacks vary.

q. Front gardens are well planted, and terracing is a feature 
of the steeper sites, especially in Nursery Street. Some 
properties are unfenced, others have low fences that 
include timber pickets, brick, post and wire, brick and 
metal, and stone.

Mt Errington Precinct

Statement of Significance

h. William and Dural Streets run parallel to the ridge, while 
Lisgar and Rosemead Roads run down the steep slopes. 
Pockets of remnant and regenerated native vegetation 
remain in the road reserves, verges and in private 
gardens. The tall tree canopy is a significant and unifying 
feature of the area, and intrinsic to the bushland setting.

i.  The subdivision of the earlier eastern section intentionally 
created smaller, narrower lots to support modest housing 
forms. In comparison, lots to the west of Lisgar Road are 
typically larger. Remnants of these historic development 
patterns are evident, with more modest houses 
constructed nearest the railway line and grander houses 
on the western ridge overlooking the valley.

Peat Ferry Road (Pacific Highway) Precinct

a. The Peat Ferry Road Precinct is significant for its 

association with the development of Hornsby as a 
railway town, and role within the old town centre.

b. The area is historically and socially significant as an 

extant example of the earliest commercial precinct in 
Hornsby.

c.  The Peats Ferry Road precinct contains a fine collection 
of Federation and Inter War period commercial and civic 
buildings. 

Mt Errington Precinct

j.  The built form is diverse and predominantly residential, 
characterised by detached single storey houses on 
separate lots. Houses from the Federation and 
Inter-War periods establish the characteristic qualities 
of the precinct.

d. The Mount Errington Precinct demonstrates the historic 
development of Hornsby, with surviving evidence of 
early development. Houses and gardens from the 
Federation and Inter War periods, and the landscape 
contribute to quality streetscapes.

k.  Front setbacks vary in response to the topography and 

e. The dramatic setting contributes to a high level of

f.  The Pretoria Parade Precinct is an example of an early 
19th century subdivision form that has a consistent 
pattern of modest single storey houses.

m. Lots have regular frontages and are typically deep. 
Some battleaxe subdivisions have occurred along 
Pretoria Parade. 

n. Residential buildings date from the Federation,

Where internal spaces of buildings are 
amalgamated, the definition of individual 
shopfronts presenting to the streetscape 
should be retained.

Original shopfronts and significant 
elements of original facades such as 
above-awning windows should be retained. 

Reconstruction of significant original 
elements and details such as awnings and 
window openings should be encouraged. 

Unsympathetic and instrusive elements 
such as air-conditioning units should be

9.3.8 The Crescent Heritage Conservation 

Statement of Significance

Area—Character Statement

The location of The Crescent Heritage Conservation Area 
(Pennant Hills) is depicted in Figure 9.3(g).

a. The Crescent Heritage Conservation Area is a very good 
example of a Federation subdivision with substantial, 
high quality period homes including Barncleuth (1909). 

History

Prescriptive Measures

a. The Crescent Heritage Conservation Area was laid out 
in 1905 by the Intercolonial Investment Land & Building 
Company following their purchase of the Aiken family’s 
41 acre orchard Hillside in 1890.

a. Development within The Crescent Heritage 

Conservation Area should be in accordance with the 
general controls within Part 9.3 and the additional 
prescriptive measures in Table 9.3.8(a).

Description

a. The landform rises gently from Pennant Hills Road 

before falling away sharply to the south east and west 
at Britannia Street. The Crescent follows the slope with 
a high and low side.

b. The lot pattern is irregular, with lots of varying sizes and 
frontage widths. Further amalgamation or subdivision of 
existing lots would potentially further erode the 
character and heritage significance of the area.

c.  The streetscape features wide kerbed road with grass 
verges and concrete footpaths. Street plantings are a 
combination of lower shrubs and taller specimens that 
blend to mature, well planted gardens.

d. Buildings date from the Federation, Edwardian and Inter 
War periods, and include a number of individually listed 
heritage items. The area also includes modern infill 
buildings, some of which are substantial in size.

e. Characteristic buildings are single and two storey brick, 
rendered masonry, timber weatherboard, fibro houses 
with hipped and gabled slate and terracotta tile roofs. 
Articulated facades with verandahs and bay windows 
are also characteristic elements. Front and side setbacks 
are irregular. 

f.  Recent changes include an infill building on the 

northern side of The Crescent, and the more recent 
medium density complex at the north western corner of 
the area.

g. Fences are typically low and constructed in stone, brick 

and timber. 

h. There are no garages to the street, other than some 

modern infill sites.

9.3.9 Wahroonga Heritage Conservation 

Description

Area —Character Statement

The location of Wahroonga Heritage Conservation Area is 
depicted in Figure 9.3(h).

History

a. The Wahroonga Heritage Conservation Area occupies 
part of the land granted to John Terry Hughes in 1842. 
Subdivision occurred in the late 19th century following 
the opening of the North Shore Railway line as the 
Pearce’s Corner Township Estate. The land within the 
Heritage Conservation Area was developed during the 
Edwardian and Post war periods.

Figure 9.3(h): Wahroonga Heritage Conservation Area. (C) 

a. The landform is relatively level, with slight falls to the 
east. The Pacific Highway and Ingram Street create 
strong boundaries to the west and south edges. The 
cutting to the railway line and F3 freeway are physical 
barriers to the north and south east.

b. The area has a regular subdivision pattern that features 
similar sized lots with consistent front setbacks. Some 
larger lots occur along the Pacific Highway. Changes and 
lot amalgamations have occurred to the underlying lot 
pattern associated with infill development.

c.  Grass swales/verges along Isis Street and mature street 
planting of varying heights are prominent streetscape 
elements.

d. Buildings are typically single storey with hipped and 
gabled roofs, and verandahs to the street. There are 
some two storey Federation Arts and Crafts and Inter 
War apartment buildings. 

e. Timber weatherboard houses are characteristic of the 

area, especially along Isis Street, and strongly define the 
built character. 

f.  The front gardens are well planted and often have no 

fencing. Where fences occur they are typically low and 
constructed of timber (some pickets), brick, timber post 
and wire, brick and metal rail, and stone. It is important 
for the area’s character to retain the pattern of low 
fences, and to continue to ensure that fence design 
matches, or is compatible with, the period of the house.

g. Common and characteristic building materials are 

weatherboard, fibro, brick and roughcast render. Roofs 
are typically corrugated metal or terracotta tiles.

Statement of Significance

a. The Wahroonga Heritage Conservation Area is an 

example of an early 19th century subdivision with a 
consistent built form of modest single and two storey 
houses. The area is closely associated with the 
construction of the North Shore railway line and Pearce’s 
corner settlement.

Description

Conservation Area — 
Character Statement

The location of the Wahroonga (North) Heritage 
Conservation Area and the Precinct boundaries is depicted 
in Figure 9.3(i).

History

a. The earliest subdivisions were offered for sale from the 
1890’s coinciding with the opening of the North Shore 
Railway Line. Development was slow to proceed with 
some land from early auctions being the part of 
later subdivisions. 

b. The major subdivisons are closely linked to the main 

building periods of the area being Victorian/Federation 
and some Inter War buildings in the southern precinct 
and Inter War and Post War buildings in the north.

NORTHERN PRECINCT 

SOUTHERN PRECINCT 

Figure 9.3(i): 
Wahroonga (North) Heritage Conservation Area and 
Precinct boundaries (C)

Northern Precinct

a. The Northern Precinct is bounded by Edgeworth David 
Avenue, the F3 Freeway, Fern Avenue, Myra Street and 
Oleander Road. 

b. The area north of Fern Avenue includes land that was 

subdivided in 1913 (Ingalara Estate) and 1926 
(Wahroonga Heights Estate). The lots are typical 
suburban subdivisions of the period with regular 
frontages. Further subdivisions of the underlying lot 
pattern are not evident.

c.  The landform slopes down from the central plateau area 
around Highlands Avenue and Fern Avenue. Street trees 
are a strong and unifying feature of the Precinct’s 
landscape character. This is complemented by mature 
trees and plantings within gardens.

d. The predominant building period (1913 to 1950) is 

represented by Inter War and Post War dwellings. This 
reflects the delay between subdivision and take up of 
land in the area. Dwellings are typically small, single 
storey buildings in garden settings with some modern 
infill buildings.

Southern Precinct

e. The Southern Precinct is bounded by Oleander Road 
(south side), Fern Avenue, the F3 Freeway, Alexandria 
Parade and Myra Street.

f.  The earliest phase of development occurred in the 

Southern Precinct where land was subdivided from the 
1890s (Bundarra Estate and Highlands Estate). 
Highlands, one of the earliest remaining houses in the 
area, was built in 1892/93. The Highlands Estate was 
progressively sold from subdivisions in 1933 (Highlands 
Estate) and 1938 (Hordern Estate).

g. The Precinct retains a character of larger estates with 
infill development, particularly on the western side of 
Bundarra Avenue. The tree canopy, wider lot frontages, 
generous setbacks, low fencing and irregular road layout 
are important elements of the area’s character.

h. Federation and Inter War houses are characteristic of 
the Precinct and represent the predominant building 
period from 1892 to 1939. Dwellings are typically two 
storey on substantial landscaped lots.

Statement of Significance

Prescriptive Measures

a. The Wahroonga (North) Heritage Conservation Area is 

closely associated with the opening of the North Shore 
Railway line in the 1890s, and includes land in the early 
estates of the locality, Bundarra Estate (1892) and its 
subsequent Federation development. It also includes 
the pre War and Inter War subdivisions of the Bundarra 
(Ingalara) Estate (1913), Wahroonga Heights Estate 
(1926) and the two divisions of the Highlands Estate 
(1933 and 1938) that led to the Inter War and Post War 
development of the area.

b. The Heritage Conservation Area is strongly associated 
with significant local persons including the Hordern 
Family and particularly the family matriarch, Caroline 
Hordern and the Hordern Family Estate which centered 
on their mansion, ‘Highlands House.’

c.  The Heritage Conservation Area is aesthetically 

distinctive, with a strong collection of Federation 
residential buildings. This includes ‘Highlands House’ 
(1892), ‘Neringla’ (1895) and ‘Cherrygarth’ (1897). 
The overlay of Inter War and Post War houses is unified 
and made complementary by the landscaped setting.

d. The Heritage Conservation Area is important as a 

reference site for Hornsby, particularly in relation to the 
early development of the area. The area has potential 
to reveal its pre Victorian development and use 
through research.

e. The Heritage Conservation Area demonstrates the post 
1892 residential development of the area, exhibiting 
built and landscape qualities that are becoming rare 
within Hornsby and which are endangered by continuing 
unsympathetic development.

a. Development within the Wahroonga (North) Heritage 
Conservation Area should be in accordance with the 
general controls within Part 9.3 and the additional 
prescriptive measures in Table 9.3.10(a).

9.3.11 Barker College Heritage Conservation 

Description

Area—Character Statement

The location of the Barker Heritage Conservation Area is 
depicted in Figure 9.3(j).

History

a. Barker College was founded in 1891 by Anglican 

Clergyman Rev Henry Plume. The school moved from 
Kurrajong Heights to Hornsby in 1896. Plume sold the 
school to William Charles Carter in 1905. The school was 
subsequently purchased by the Church of England in 1919 
and now occupies the land between the Pacific Highway, 
College Crescent, Clarke Road and Unwin Road.

Figure 9.3(j): Barker Heritage Conservation Area. (C)

a. The landform falls from the Pacific Highway to the 

south. The college campus has designated areas – the 
Middle and Senior School to the north, open grounds in 
the centre and the Junior School to the south. 

b. There are views across the school grounds from north 
to south, and from east to west, and along the internal 
streets. Future development should seek to minimise 
impacts on existing view corridors, and to create new 
view lines where possible, such as across the grounds 
from the Avenue to the west and the like.

c.  There are three individual heritage items within the 

Heritage Conservation Area. These are “Barker College 
group of buildings, grounds and gate”, “Barker College 
- Centenary Design Centre, Mc Caskill Music Centre, 
the Development Office” and the “Barker College 
Junior School”. 

d. The Barker College Heritage Conservation Management 
Plan 1998 ranks the relative significance of buildings on 
the site. Buildings of high significance are to be 
retained, while buildings of moderate significance 
options should be investigated for retention in terms of 
providing a function that cannot be provided elsewhere 
by long term planning.

Statement of Significance

a. The Barker College Heritage Conservation Area is 

significant as a long established educational institution 
in Hornsby. The college grounds have developed over 
time with a character achieved through consistent scale, 
use of materials, architectural style and landscaping. 

b. Barker College demonstrates its own history through it 
character, range of buildings and landscape features, 
and is appreciated by a community of past and present 
students, teachers and others associated with the college.

c.  The Heritage Conservation Area contributes to the local 

townscape through its buildings, gardens and 
prominent trees.

9.3.12 East Epping Heritage Conservation 

Description

Area—Character Statement

The location of the East Epping Heritage Conservation 
Area is depicted in Figure 9.3(k).

History

a. The East Epping Heritage Conservation Area comprises 
part of the Field of Mars Common which was released 
for subdivision in 1886. 

b. Opening of the railway line in 1886 and new road 

networks preceeded a period of rapid development. 
Railway workers and wider population were attracted to 
the area and local farmers prospered having more 
access to markets.

c.  The name “Epping” was officially adopted for the area 
in 1899, derived from the many trees in the area after 
“Epping Forest” in England. The streets were named 
after English counties or towns as the area was 
described like a “country village”.

d. Completion of Epping Road in 1940 and improvement of 
road networks led to an Inter-war period of subdivision 
and development. Further development continued into 
the 1950s Post-war period which saw a significant 
change to the character of the area. 

a. The East Epping Heritage Conservation Area represents 
an area of housing that has remained largely intact. It  
retains many elements of the various housing styles 
and the early subdivision patterns from the 1886 to the 
period just after the Second World War.

b. The housing styles characteristically include single 

detached houses from the Federation, Inter-war and 
Post-war periods with some earlier Victorian housing 
and late 20th century development located between.  

c.  A number of heritage listed items are located within the 
area, many of which occupy prominent corner sites and 
make a positive visual contribution to the streetscapes. 
Some items are distinctive and uniqure features in the 
streetscape or are relatively rare examples in the local 
area.

d. The area is characterised by wide, dual carriageways, 

wide grassed verges and pedestrian footpaths.  

e. A number of mature native and introduced, ornamental 
trees and plantings generally line the streets. Together 
with individual garden settings and plantings, the 
landscape elements enhance the built context. 

Figure 9.3(k): East Epping Heritage Conservation Area. (C)

HORNSBY DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN 2013 | HERITAGE(THIS CHAPTER WAS LAST AMENDED ON 10 JANUARY 2019)9-35

f.  A number of houses retain original and complimentary 

fences which contribute to the suburban garden setting. 

Table 9.3.12(a): Additional Prescriptive Measures - East 
Epping HCA Provisions 

g. The early natural character and topography of the area is 

Element

Additional Prescriptive Measures

indicated by extant rock forms, undulating streets, 
sloping sites and the number of native trees and 
plantings.

h. The streets and subdivision generally comprises a 

regular grid type pattern, with the exception of Oxford 
Street, and Norfolk Road forming the main spine of the 
conservation area. 

i.  The character of the area is unified by the similarity in 

allotment sizes, scale of building and openings, setbacks 
from the street, fencing, detailing and landscape 
elements. 

Statement of Significance

j.  The East Epping Heritage Conservation Area is of high 

local historic and aesthetic significance as a good 
representative example of late 19th century subdivision. 
It retains a good and largely intact example of 
Federation, Inter-War and Post-war period residential 
development that represents the major period of growth 
and development of the Epping area. 

k.  The area significantly retains most of its original 1886 

subdivision and streetscape pattern with mostly single 
detached houses.  

l.  The built context is enhanced by the local topography 
and native plantings, wide street proportions, street 
trees and garden settings.

m. The Epping Public School site on Norfolk Road 

established in 1900 and the Inter-war period Uniting 
Church at the intersection of Chester, Oxford and Essex 
Streets are of historic and social significance to the 
locality. 

Prescriptive Measures

a. Development within the East Epping Heritage 

Conservation Area should be in accordance with the 
general controls within Part 9.3 and the additional 
prescriptive measures in Table 9.3.12(a).

9.3.14 Rosebank Avenue (Epping) Heritage 
Conservation Area —Character 
Statement

e. A strict building ordinance was put in place to ensure 
that “each home will be worthy of its setting”and that 
the layout and lot sizes allowed “ample space for 
gardens, lawns and motor car entrance”. 

The location of the Rosebank Avenue (Epping) Heritage 
Conservation Area is depicted in Figure 9.3(m).

Description

History

a. Rosebank Avenue was originally part of the land granted 
to William Kent Junior, purchased by Pioneer settler, 
David Hazlewood in 1897. In 1908 David Hazlewood’s 
sons Walter and Harry Hazelwood developed a rose 
growing industry within the Hazelwood Estate, which 
became the Hazlewood Brothers Nursery and leading 
rose suppliers in the early twentieth century.

b. The first subdivision of the Hazlewood Estate was 

placed on sale in October 1921. In November 1929, two 
years after David Hazlewood’s death, the site of 
Rosebank Avenue went to auction sale as the 
Rosegrove Estate, one of the later estate subdivisons to 
occur within the Epping district. 

c.  The Estate consisted of 18 lots fronting Rosebank 

Avenue and three lots fronting Ray Road. 17 properties 
in seperate ownership (one of which was constructed 
over two of the original lots) were developed for 
residential dwelling houses during the Inter-war period, 
between 1929 and 1942. 

d. A “fine old rustic bridge” which was constructed over 
the existing creek by the Hazlewoods as part of their 
nursery operations was retained as an attractive 
element of the Estate. 

a. A rare example of a good and highly intact Inter-war 

streetscape within Hornsby Shire.

b. The group of Inter-war period dwellings illustrate various 
characteristic Inter-war architectural elements from the 
Bungalow, Tudor Revival and Spanish Mission styles. 

c.  Generally the buildings retain their original scale, form, 
character and presentation, evidence of the original 

intent and covenants placed on the subdivision. 

d. Recent alterations and additions and minor 

modifications are evident, however, do not detract from 
the overall character and quality of the group and 
streetscape.

e. The unifying character of the streetscape arises from 
the retention of the original subdivision pattern and 
street rhythm, consistent setbacks, style and character 
of the buildings, scale of buildings and openings, 
building materials and colours, fencing, paths, 
driveways, garages, and landscale elements.

f.  The gardens and landscaping reflect the typical 

characteristics and features of the Inter-war period. 

g. The single-laned bridge (modernised) associated with 
the Hazelwood Brothers Nursury and creek are still in 
existence and provides evidence of the early character 
of the area. 

Statement of Significance

a. Rosebank Avenue is of high local cultural significance as 
a fine representative example of an Inter-war period 
residential subdivision and development that remains 
largely intact and retains its historical subdivision 
pattern, built context and natural features. 

b. Collectively the group form a unique precinct in Hornsby 

Shire. 

c.  The houses each retain their overall scale, character and 
varying stylistics details associated with the period and 
are enhanced by the wide street proportion, street trees 
and garden settings and remaining natural features.

9-41

9.4.1 Development in the Vicinity of 

Heritage Items and Heritage 
Conservation Areas

Desired Outcomes

a. New work that is sympathetic to the heritage 

significance of nearby heritage items, or adjoining 
heritage conservation area, and their settings.

Prescriptive Measures

Heritage Items

a. Design and siting of new work should complement the 
form, orientation, scale and style of the heritage item.

b. Adequate space should be provided around the heritage 

item to allow for its interpretation.

c.  Development should maintain significant or historic 
public domain views to and from the heritage item.

d. Original or significant landscape features that are 

associated with the heritage item and which contribute 
to its setting should be retained.

e. For rural heritage items, the scale of new work is not to 
overwhelm the heritage item taking into consideration 
the matters within the Rural Heritage Items element.

Heritage Conservation Areas

f.  Development in the vicinity must repect the curtilage 

and setting of the HCA and protect views into and from 
the HCA. 

g. Development is to be sympathetic to the primary 

characteristics and heritage values of the HCA with 
regards to proposed:

 context, including backdrop to places in the HCA;

 bulk, height alignment form and roofline of new 

development;

 proportions such as windows and door openings 

(number and location) and balconies;

 Interface facade materials, treatments and palette;

 Compatable fencing and screening.

h. Development applications for multi-unit developments 
adjacent to HCAs must include a construction impact 
report demonstrating that the construction process will 
not detrimentally or indirectly adversely impact places in 
the HCA at the time of construction or over time. 

Notes: 

These controls apply to land that is adjoining, or across the road 
from a heritage item or a heritage conservation area.

The setting of a heritage item or heritage conservation area 
often extends beyond current property boundaries, and can 
be influenced by historic subdivision patterns, topography, 
vegetation, and views to and from the heritage item or heritage 
conservation area.

It is important to understand the relationship of a heritage item, 
or heritage conservation area, to adjoining land. Relevant factors 
include:

 Is the site within historic property boundaries of the 

heritage item;

 Could development on the site affect views to or from the 

heritage item or heritage conservation area;

 Could development on the site change the visual backdrop 

of the heritage item or heritage 
conservation area;

 Is the heritage item or heritage conservation area physically 
separated from the development site by a road, gully or 
escarpment, creek or similar; and

 Are there any trees or remnant features on the 

development site that may have had an association with 
the heritage item.

9.5 Aboriginal Heritage

9.5.1 Aboriginal Relics or Places of 

Notes:

Heritage Significance

This section provides guidelines for the development of 
land that may contain an Aboriginal relic or place of 
heritage significance.

Desired Outcomes

a. Development that protects Aboriginal sites and 

archaeological relics by minimising the likelihood 
of disturbance.

Prescriptive Measures

a. An assessment of Aboriginal heritage should 

accompany any development application on lands that 
contain culturally modified trees or recorded 
Aboriginal objects.  

b. An assessment of Aboriginal heritage should 

accompany any development application for work to 
land that has not been disturbed and is:

Land is disturbed if it has been the subject of a human activity 
that has changed the land’s surface, being changes that remain 
clear and observable. Examples include ploughing, construction 
of rural infrastructure (such as dams and fences), construction 
of roads, trails and tracks, clearing vegetation, construction of 
buildings and the erection of other structures, construction or 
installation of utilities and other similar services.

For further information on best practice guidelines refer to:

 Guide to investigating, assessing and reporting on 

Aboriginal cultural heritage in NSW 2011, and

 Due Diligence Code of Practice for the Protection of 

Aboriginal Objects in NSW (2010) 

by NSW Office of Environment & Heritage available at 
environment.nsw.gov.au. 

For further information and to obtain a certificate from the 
Aboriginal Heritage and Information Management System 
(AHIMS) database refer to the NSW Office of Environment & 
Heritage website www.environment.nsw.gov.au. 

Aboriginal heritage sites and archaeological relics can occur in a 
range of places, including private property. In Hornsby Aboriginal 
sites include:

 within 200 metres of waterways; 

 Engravings on sandstone ridges;

 located within a sand dune system; 

 located on a ridge top, ridge line or headland; 

 Rock shelters on the valley slopes containing cave 

paintings,drawing sites and archaeological deposits;

 Open campsites and grinding grooves on valley floors;

 located within 200 metres below or above a cliff face; 

 Shell middens along tidal waterways; and

or

 Scarred trees.

An Aboriginal Heritage Impact Permit is required from the NSW 
Office of Environment & Heritage where development may 
damage or disturb Aboriginal sites under the National Parks and 
Wildlife Act 1974.

 within 20 metres of or in a cave, rock shelter or a 

cave mouth.

c.  When an assessment of Aboriginal heritage is required, 

a report should be prepared in accordance with 
published best practice guidelines and submitted with 
the Development Application. This should include an 
Aboriginal Heritage and Information Management 
System certificate for property that contains listed 
objects/ sites.

d. Works, including landscaping and associated elements, 
should be located away from sites and potential sites 
containing archaeological relics.

e. The depth and extent of excavation should be minimised 

where land contains, or is likely to contain, 
archaeological remains or relics.

building, only one step is required for a side elevation 
that would directly face the existing building.

g. Additional articulation of facades should be achieved by 

division of all facades into vertical “panels” that 
generally are not wider than 8 metres, with adjoining 
panels separated and by steps of at least 1 metre which 

should be achieved by:

 Indentations or projections in the alignment of 

exterior walls, or

 Balconies or terraces that project from exterior walls, 

and

 Eaves, pergolas and awnings that project from 

exterior walls.

Note:  To achieve articulation the following is encouraged:

 Windows that display vertical proportions and, except for 
top storeys, are arranged as regular patterns of openings 
that are ‘cut’ through brick walls. 

h. Facades should incorporate corner treatments such as 
wrap-around balconies, flat roof forms with eaves and 
other elements to cast shadows and visually break up 
the built form.

i.  Facade elements should not be repetitive and should: 

 use a range of materials and finishes; 

 use a minimum of 30% exposed brick or natural 

material cladding (such as sandstone or timber); and

 not be fully rendered.

j.  Top storeys should be visually-recessive: exterior walls 
should employ light-weight cladding and extensive

incorporate mezzanine levels).

k.  Exterior walls should be substantially face brick in 

medium to darker tones, although a proportion of walls 

may include painted brickwork and render.

l.  Balconies should be supported by a combination of 

masonry piers and metal posts, some set behind the 
alignment of a buildings exterior walls. Balustrades and 
parapets should predominantly be painted brickwork, 
sheet or board cladding, or metal railings. A minor 
proportion of balustrades may be glazed.
